In my dreams


In my dreams I can fly 
Around the globe and everyone will say hi


In my dreams there is no pain 
And that poor old man will never miss his train 


In my dreams we all have enough to eat
And all the worlds kids have shoes on their feet 


In my dreams I’m an action star
Riding around in a fancy sports car


In my dreams I’ve found love 
And at my wedding there were 1000 white doves


In my dreams there is no Gardenscapes™
So I don’t get stuck with one of those misleading ads when I’m just trying to break my arcade mode record in fruit ninja after redownloading it for a road trip


You know those ones where they make you fake play the game but if you tap where it tells you it’ll take you to the App Store and at the end of like 30 seconds or something the little x pops up but your finger is too big and you click the ad anyways and get sent to the App Store and then once you get back and actually click the x you get to play like max one more round and get hit with ANOTHER fucking ad?  Like come on we all know those puzzles aren’t what the game is actually like! But did I download it anyway?? YES! And did I enjoy it for about 5 months until it got too hard and I rage deleted it?? Obviously!! And then I feel shame every time I see the ad because I know it played its dirty little tricks in me and fucking won and it makes me wanna throw my phone out the window and———


In my dreams we found world peace 
And I can go where mama Mia was filmed in Greece 


In my dreams I made my true home
One where I am never alone


And in my dreams I won’t wake up 
And have to deal with these fucking garden scapes ads again

Constantine's Basilica


The shell remains,
Though cleaved and crumbled.
It cannot contain


The populace anymore than
The Colosseum,
Whose white walls rot to dirty tan;


The plaque builds
Up on unused bones and yellows marble
Swords and shields.


But this shell still stands as a red husk
Of brittle brick,
The remnants of some gargantuan mollusk.


Empty sockets
Are the arches who saw an empire
That rotted,


And the inside is pitted with cavities
Inverted from
The geometric armor of tortoises. 


Fractured are
The bones exposed to elements and treated
With little care-


Was this shell molted, forgotten by man?
Or was the beast it housed
Killed far away on an eastern plain?


Repurposed for
The monuments of new gods and new kings,
The bones were


Strewn about after the giant’s death;
Now these remnants of
The autochthonous beast return to the earth.

Grandma’s House
The faint smell of cologne makes its way up and across my grandma’s terrace. Through the sliding doors, the steady pounding of the bass echoes through the courtyard. Pulsing below, the dim orange glow of a cigarette. The young man, who had been pacing in the cramped terrace below, takes a drag as he sits on a crate. His friend joins him. Countless voices from the kitchen and the clink of silverware, a busy Saturday evening.                        
It is late and the sky is turning into wine, only covered by flat grey clouds, a mix of smog and rain soon to come. The neighbors across from my grandma’s curl up on the sofa. A bowl of watermelon and a slow hug as the kids fall asleep. Their father collapsed on the sofa, a glass of wine beside him. Again, the cologne rises and falls. The man is pacing again, speaking excitedly on the phone, cigarette in hand. His friend is gone, back into the crowded kitchen. Everyone is nestled in their boxes, unevenly spread into a trapezoid of sorts.                                
A late summer dinner glows from one of the terraces. Covered by a cloth tent, a soft conversation of how the kids are doing. In the distance, tires screech, a car honks. Two girls climb out into the alleyway terrace behind the kitchen, cigarettes in hand. As they open the sliding doors, I catch a fragment of a complaint, beer in hand to distract themselves from their low paying week. A curl of smoke makes its way up to me and for an instant, I am in the alleyway, glass in hand, pounding in my ears, and a faint smile on my face as the dark summer air sneaks its way through the doors and into that packed kitchen.

i liked that she was so angry. 
i never knew someone so thin could be so angry.
id’ve thought there wasn’t enough space for rage, 
enough space for anything but an aching, swollen brain and cigarette legs.
of course i’d known about what she had done
probably since i started liking poems and feeling stale
but still, i didn’t read the bell jar until i was seventeen
and by then it was too late anyways, i was seventeen years old and 
fifty years too late to a book launch planned at a funeral,
to a story already studied in black and white by millions of me’s,
that sort of “black hair type” that so many grandmothers and headmistresses loathe,
to the story that goes: 


sylvie, i have had to kill you
you died before i had time-


ash, rise, red, hair,
brute, boot, mistress,
december, fire, genius, mad 


i felt she was my patron saint,
a holy mourner lying in wait until i’d come of natural dying age, 
siren call to the northeast where she’d been long before me


and now i have pictures of her on my wall, 
and i listen to her read her poems through headphones, 
and i swear i won’t ever read ted hughes, 
and i think sylvia would be a good name for a daughter, 
but mostly i wonder if she would have hated me, 
or if i would have hated her 
or if we would have been friends.

Beauty is in the Eye of the Beholder


We count our dollars on the train to the party, sucking on blow-pops, and playing with the gold chains that swing on our necks and the gold hoops that hang on our ears. We are the youth, the urban kids people like to pity. Because we have shit against us, but it’s edgy to be outcasts. So I guess we’re cool with it, I mean it’s all we know and I don’t think we’d want it any other way.
“How much do we need to get in again?” Shae asks before licking her thumb and swiping through a small stash of single dollars.
Dondé holds up the number five before going back to gulping down the Hennessy in the brown paper bag.
“Aight, that works. I got five for the party and ten for food. Where we tryna eat?” Shae asks before she snatches the alcohol from Dondé.
“Shit, you almost fucking spilled it, Shae! I don’t give a fuck where we eat, let’s just get to the damn party first,” Dondé says re-tying his Jordans for the 10th time. 
We’ve all been pretty close since elementary school, gone from one stage of life to another, hand-in-hand. Witnessed shit little kids shouldn’t watch happen in front of them. Dondé watched his father get shot in front of his own eyes by a few thugs from a rival gang. Rappers don’t know “gang shit” until they’ve witnessed shit like that. 
Shae’s been in foster care since she was six, it’s the only life she remembers and the only life she wants to remember, except she has a very fuzzy image of her mother that she tries to erase from her memory. Seeing the face of the woman who gave you up because she didn’t deem you worthy of her love is an image that I wouldn’t curse upon my worst enemy. 
RJ has it a little better than the rest of us, he’s got two loving parents that make good money. That’s why we always hang out at his house, he lives comfortably. Or at least his physical being lives comfortably, his soul and mental state live in war. Pastor’s son...pastor’s gay son. It’s the little shit, the behind-closed-doors shit that can fucking cause the most pain.
Then there’s Greg, full name Gregory. We joke around that his mother didn’t love him with a name like Gregory. He fucking agrees, that’s why he goes by his last name: Mercado. He’s raised by his grandmother cause both of his parents are in jail; dad’s there’s for life, mom’s there for three more months. Then she’s out. And Mercado can’t stop talking about it, I don’t blame him, I’d be happy too. Shit, I miss my mom too.
We clean up pretty nicely, at least during the weekdays. Only then do we dress to impress the white men who run our society. Only then do we conform to society’s standards of power and success. Only then do we peel off our skin and tuck it in our bookbags. 
“Grand Army Plaza is the next stop,” the intercom says throughout the train car.
Before the door closes two police officers enter the train rocking a golden badge on their chest, a taser on their left hip, and a gun on their right. They look down the car and their beady blue eyes land on us. Staring us up and down, inspecting how deep our blackness runs. 
It runs pretty deep.
Shae picks on her Bob Marley twists as she hides the alcohol behind her back.
I stare at the officers, at the way they wear their guns like the way Dondé wears his gold chains. The way their navy blue hats sit tight on their head and block their eyes from the yellow luminescent lights on the ceiling of the train.
RJ twists on the state championship ring on his right hand and his hazel eyes glimpse at me before looking at the officers whose eyes haven’t dropped from the group of black kids making a nuisance on the train.
We are those Black kids. Even though not all of us are Black. But that’s the way they see us. Not as the few kids who are simply excited for a party they’ve been planning to attend this entire month. Or the kids who can’t wait to graduate high school, together...as one...as a family. Because that’s what we are: a family. 
The cleanliness of the Grand Army Plaza train station makes Dondé’s dark skin glisten and his black eyes turn a dark-brown. He licks his lips and makes sure to keep his hands in front of him, where everyone can see them. Where his enemies can see them. The enemy of my enemy is my friend, I guess that’s why we’re all friends.
Shae scoots over to me. “What do I do with the alcohol?” she whispers in my ears, still picking on her twists.
“I don’t know, but just chill,” I say as I rub the sweat on my palms on my black jeans.
“What’s our stop?” she questions, scanning the list of stops on the other side of the train.
“The next one. Yo, just chill. You’re making me nervous,” I say before sitting back and resting my head on the train walls.
Dondé gets up from his seat and faces the train doors. The cops step a little closer to us and right behind Dondé, almost breathing down his neck.
“Can I help you, sir?” Dondé says to the cop directly behind him. His chest rises up and down, quicker with each syllable and I watch his nose flare. It wasn’t anger. It was fear. Cause although we should be angry with shit like this, we can’t help but still fear the events the next few seconds can bring.
“Yes, you can. Can I have your ID?” the blond-haired officer says, gesturing his hand out.
“I’m reaching for my wallet, and imma do it slowly...ok?” Dondé says lifting his hands up, almost in surrender.
His right hand reaches for his wallet in his back pocket and he pulls out his ID. The train car watches the events, some recording, some stepping back. The less you see, the less of a reality it seems.
The officer snatches Dondé’s ID. “You’re 18,” he says before handing it to the dark-haired cop behind him.
He pulls out some handcuffs and slams Dondé’s body on the train doors. I watch his face hit the window and blood drip from his nose.
“Yo, what’d he do?” RJ asks, rising from his seat.
Before he can get out another sentence, the dark-haired cop drags RJ to the floor and gets on top of him. Keeping his knee on his back, handcuffing his hands together behind him.
“No! Please stop, what did he do? Stop!” Shae yells pushing on the officer, pleading with him.
“Underage drinking is a misdemeanor,” the blond-haired officer says before hauling Dondé’s bloody face to the ground. I watch as he kisses the floor, then as he stares into my eyes. His dark eyes scream for help and beg for mercy at the same time. They say good-bye. They say ‘don’t forget about me’.
“I...I can’t breathe...I can’t breathe,” RJ says on the ground, his body going numb and his eyes vacantly stare at the people watching.
The cop’s knee jabs deeper into RJ’s back and his hands go from handcuffing his hands to the back of his neck, pressing his head into the ground.
“Yo everybody drinks man. We’re 18! I could give you a list of white kids who started drinking younger than us. You gon’ do this same shit to them too?” Mercado yells in front of the dark-haired officer.
The cop ignores him.
“This shit is so fucked up. Again! Again! How many more?” Mercado yells again as he reaches for his phone in his jacket pocket.
And I watch it all in slow-motion. I watch the officer’s attention go from RJ to Mercado. His hands go from RJ’s head to his right hip.
The phone that Mercado wanted to pull out stayed in his denim jacket pocket. His dad’s denim jacket. Next to the pendant of his favorite gold chain sat his custom-made bullet hole. Like magnets, his body falls to the ground and sticks there. I watch as his soul leaves his body through his empty eyes. His green eyes. The green eyes that he got from his mom. The mom he couldn’t wait to see.
“NO! Mercado! No, please! No, please don’t leave us,” Shae says as she shakes his body, trying to wake him up from the everlasting slumber he’s fallen into.
But there’s no hope. There’s no waking him up. Cause he’s gone and that’s just the fact of the matter.
I sit on the ground, between an almost lifeless RJ and a dead Mercado. Dondé’s still on the ground and the blood from his nose and the tears from his eyes look like paint on his face. A work of art.
To be Black in America is to look both ways on a 1-way street. It’s the feeling of being strangled by the stems of the flowers you bloomed. It’s the feeling of knowing every face but your own. It’s drowning your blood in alcohol, spraying gas on a flame. Because the worst things in life come free to us.
Surrounded by recording cameras, I stare into one of them, a red phone that I see on the other end of the train. Hands soaked in blood, face drenched in my tears. Blood streaming down the train and the sound of RJ’s last breath whispers in my ear.


A work of art.

GENERATION INC.        SEPT. 10, 2082


PRESS 
RELEASE


GENERATION CEO, MIKE BENNIKY, ANNOUNCES RETURN TRIP TO ENCELADUS BASE. 


Cape Town, South Africa and New York, NY, USA — Generation Inc. (Nasdaq: GENI) announced an expansion of their Collective Journey initiative launched 3 years ago. The Journey set out to establish a permanent base on the moon Enceladus in order to retrieve necessary water and ice for the Generation clientele and broader shareholders. This past week, the initiative grew to support three more technicians, a doctor, and a hydroponics engineer, all of which are set to launch from the Cape of Good Hope this coming Friday, September 13th. 


According to market researchers at the Institute for Sustainable Commerce (ISC), the move will boost supply of fresh water to the communities under Generation’s subsidiaries. ISC also reports that the change will make the company’s targets of 100% affordable fresh water available for all clients more realistic and “will provide more than adequate manpower to achieve company standards—even ahead of schedule”


“We are dedicated to making this initiative work for everyone, regardless of the pricetag,” said Head of Research and Development Arjun Mallory. “With the new crew enroute to Enceladus, the base will have more support than ever, a change that we’ve been pushing for over the past year and a half.”


CEO Mike Benniky addressed the company in an all-employee webcast this past friday, congratulating the teams that have worked on the project for the past month. “We’ve seen extreme flexibility in our employees’ abilities to adjust with changing timelines and shifting priorities. It is because of their tireless dedication to the Generation clientele that this launch will happen so soon.” Generation’s additional flight in their Collective Journey initiative will set the record for farthest manned flight for a rocket carrying 5 people.


Today’s announcement comes after an incident on August 12th at the station, which Generation plans on addressing in the future. “These plans have been in action since the beginning of the program” Benniky says “And more than anything, it represents our company’s willingness to venture to parts unknown for the betterment of our stakeholders.”

u/XEmperor45 7 days ago
Ex-Generation employee here. This doesn’t surprise me. The company worked hard to keep its name out of the media and it shows why now. That quote from the press release leaves out the context... “The additional personnel added to Enceladus base comes as a result of the lost communications between Earth and their base on Saturn’s moon, a move that has proved costly. However, their new probe into Saturn’s orbit... will provide more than adequate manpower to achieve company standards—even ahead of schedule.” Kinda shady to do something like that, but not my prob anymore. Company should do more but they won’t. AMA. 


     u/Fearraiser 7 days ago
     When did you quit/stop working at G?


          u/XEmperor45 7 days ago
Stopped working a few days before we lost connection with the crew at Enceladus. They kept it under wraps so I don’t have much info on it. But I heard that some of the crew died. Horror stories went around about one of them killing the other. Wouldn’t be surprised if they’re sending a goddamn therapist on with the new crew. They’re gonna need it I bet.


 u/Fearraiser 5 days ago
Think anything will come of it? They just gonna push it under the rug?


u/XEmperor45 5 days ago
If anything comes of it, it’ll come 30 years down the line unfortunately. Worked there for over 20 years from an intern all the way to head of facilities. In that time they had a few threats of protest. But nothing came of those. Only time something happen is if news catches on. 


Edit: Holy shit this blew up. 30k upvotes.
Edit 2: OMFG what the hell??? 100k???

Generation Stock Plummets After Details Expose Dead Employee
  

By: Jim Frayle and Michelle Pope
Today at 6:00 am EDT


A tumultuous week followed Generation Inc.’s (▼109.66) recent launch into space, sending 5 more employees to their experimental base on Enceladus. The Saturn moon base has collected its fair share of backlash with many critics harking against its pricetag and lack of a return on investment. Yet, Generation’s successful flight this past Friday could not save the company amid allegations of media bribery and a disaster previously unknown that happened on its base in mid-August. 


Stories ran over a month ago claim that the base lost contact with Generation HQ in South Africa. An anonymous source from inside the company tells the New York Times that a loss of communications may be a cover-up for a far more sinister story.


“Everyone who knew anything was living and working in fear of reprisal” said the anonymous employee from Generation when interviewing with The Times’ Michelle Pope. The employee notes that many theories flew around the office during the past month, with many employees demanding a response from their superiors. When asked if they did the same, the employee decided not to comment. “It all changed when the press release went out.”
Employees threatened to strike against the company. What once was considered the nuclear option now was gaining traction as the only option. Federal law prohibits most strikes by workers in companies considered “essential” or “public services.” With Generation fielding over 100 million citizen’s fresh water needs, the legal battles risked by a strike were seen as “inconceivable and outright absurd,” says the employee. But many were willing to take that risk.


After executives at Generation caught wind of the protest, news broke about the death of one of the men on Enceladus. No details about the man’s death have come out except for the man’s name, Michael Cresson. Which leaves one sole man on the moon, Siddhartha Hill. 


When asked about how the workforce responded, the whistleblower said “Lots of us started to wonder… how did they know?”


For months, the story has been that a communications error shut down the connection between Enceladus base and Cape Town. “But now,” the whistleblower says, “the doors are open for conspiracy.” 


Generation denied The Times’ request for comment. 


This is a developing story. Check back for updates as more information becomes available.

“… While the impressive nature of Enceladus’ new corporate base allows for exponential scientific inquiry into the surrounding cosmos, the fact of Generation’s corporate structure makes it a wholly inadequate victory and one that will surely be short-lived. Competitive hierarchies ingrained in the corporate setting force priorities towards all-or-nothing strategies of space travel where human lives are devalued and even forgotten altogether. In light of recent protests, the structures and desires of Generation (the company) does not align with that of Generation (the people it supports). With mechanisms in place that supply over 100 million people with access to fresh water, the failure of a company like Generation comes with backlash on a completely different level compared to that of one of its planet-bound subsidiaries. To claim Enceladus as anything but a PR stunt would overlook the corporate shortcomings of managing such an alien site as well the comical metaphor associated with Enceladus himself[1]...”


“… To consider the political ramifications of Generation within its South African home country would benefit a paper far longer and more in-depth. However, the consideration of the consideration itself must suffice as the political influence of Generation cannot be ignored. Generation as a company concerns itself with the welfare of the people to a point where dangerous expeditions like Enceladus and their previous “Collective Journey” initiative equate more to reckless earmark spending rather than the supposed innovation that the executives at Generation claim[2]…”


“… The distinct lack of government oversight and response following the folly of Mike Benniky leaves only one option, and the employees of Generation figured that out just recently when nearly 83% of them walked out. Where Generation claims to care for clients like their own people, what message does it send when nearly all of their people claim ‘everyone who knew anything was living and working in fear of reprisal[3].’ Moreover, what message does it send when their mission to Enceladus ends in their own employee dying?...”

Sidd, 


Maybe I should’ve said this sooner—but I need help. I can’t stop myself. It’s every night. Every fucking goddamn night. I come down to this stupid fucking window and look out, hoping, PRAYING that I might find something out there. A light that’ll cure me. A shooting star to… I don’t know, to wish on? I don’t need a wish– I need fucking help. 


Why do I think like this?? My mind is BROKEN. It doesn’t think right or it doesn’t think at all it just FEELS. It feels the urge to bend me like metal. And I can’t stop it. I’m weak. Every night it takes me and twists everything inside of me until I give in. Do you know what I mean? If you don’t maybe you never will because I can’t say it. I can’t admit it. WHY CAN’T I SAY IT EVEN NOW.


Please. I can’t do this anymore. It’s too dark. Too cold. Too quiet. I can’t do it. Please, if you read this, don’t judge me—I just need help.


Fuck it. Tell my sister that I died on the job. She’s too young to know.


Mike

GENERATION INC.        NOV. 10 , 2082


PRESS 
RELEASE


GENERATION ANNOUNCES FOUNDATION TO COMMEMORATE EMPLOYEES OF ENCELADUS BASE. 


Cape Town, South Africa — Generation Inc. (Nasdaq: GENI) announced a new foundation today called ENROUTE, a philanthropic giving platform focused on combatting mental illness. “We want to thank the employees who put their minds and lives on the line for the betterment of our clients. Without them, we are nothing,” says Generation CEO, Mike Benniky during a press conference held during the launch of the new foundation. In its inception, Benniky himself offered $3 million donation with an addition $3 million in matching donations for Generation employees. The goal was met within the hour. 


ENROUTE works with global non-profits to bring mental health awareness to all of those in need, especially underserved and underrepresented groups. “Its a topic we rarely discuss as a society, and one that deserves more attention,” says the head of the foundation, Teresa Garcia. Generation currently plans to partner with organizations in South Africa, India, and greater Oceania, but has plans to expand into all its global markets early next year. 


The name is multi-representational. ENROUTE signifies the astronauts currently enroute to Enceladus as well as those who have yet to take off for future missions. Astronauts play a key role in Generation’s business affairs, and thus their place in the new foundation is crucial. The name also represents the help that Generation will provide all across the globe. “It is a vehicle for change,” Benniky says, “like the ships going towards the stars, Generation will go out to the people and to those in need.”  


Today’s announcement comes after an incident on August 12th at Enceladus base. “There are no words that can explain out gratitude and grief” Benniky says in reference to the deceased employee “It is Generation’s solemn hope that ENROUTE can live up to Michael’s memory and help those in need.”

Body of Drowned Man Washes On Shore of Mystic River
By Jackson Henney, Associate Editor


SOMERVILLE, Mass. — Last Sunday, the body of a man was found floating on the surface of the Mystic River. Standby accounts of the man told The Globe that the body looked “bloated and green.” The coroner’s office concluded that the victim drowned. Somerville Police are not willing to rule out fowl play at this time. 


“It’s a tragedy” said the Chief of the Somerville Police Department, Fred Morris. “Sad to see someone so young end up in such dire straights.” The man, whose identity remains unconfirmed, looks to have been “mid-twenties at the time of death,” according to the coroner’s office. 


The City of Boston launched an official investigation to look into the drownings after a similar situation happened the week prior, continuing the patterned drownings that have happened   
Passive verb. “occurred”
                                                                                             over the past 12 weeks. “The man found along the banks of Watertown leave us with little option but to investigate” Councilmember Margaret Larabee told The Globe last week.


“It scares me that my kids might have to see that,” Janine Haro, a local mother from Somerville says when asked about the incident last Sunday. “Of course, we never want something like that to happen to anyone in our community, but to see it in such a visceral way? It’s harrowing.” 
  
  

Fred Morris told The Globe that he planned on heading the investigation with Boston City Police, if given the opportunity. “This is my community,” Morris says, “and that means it’s my duty and the duty of all of us in town to protect our neighbors—its only a shame that no one helped these poor folks until it was too late.”      
These are unnecessary details. Omit.
Alongside the investigation, researchers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) explored the currents of the Charles River in an effort to trace the location of these deaths. “Astronomical tides over the recent weeks have made detecting reliable patterns difficult. Boston Harbor, in particular, makes any sort of tracking difficult given the number of trade ships moving in and out on a daily basis.” 


Despite setbacks, researchers discovered that, if all bodies turned up in the Charles instead of adjoining rivers like the Mystic River, then chances are the drownings occurred within the river itself—not, as many have suggested, in the harbor islands.    
Sentence structure is overly complex.
Given the death of Thomas O’Dougherty 
Didn’t you say before that his identity is unconfirmed?
                                        last Sunday, NOAA’s unlikely scenario seems to have come true. A Boston Police representative told The Globe that officers would investigate the islands in the coming weeks. Given the frequency of these deaths, it looks like more people are set to die in that time.       
Overly subjective and comes off judgemental
Boston Harbor islands continue to mystify visitors with horror stories surrounding many of the islands’ pasts. The movie Shutter Island, infamous for its success as a psychological thriller makes it a cult classic in the horror genre—as well as one of the largest reasons for visiting the harbor islands and, specifically, Long Island. 
Off-topic, remove.
Based on data from NOAA, current trends show a clear passage between major islands such as Deer, Spectacle, and Long. When brought up with the Boston City Police, these ideas were pushed aside. “The islands will be swept comprehensively in due time” said a representative from the police force. “Please do not engage in these activities on your own.” They warned. 
You seem to be getting off track. These ideas are not yet fleshed out and are not 
the reason for this article. I recommend staying on the point about Somerville.  
I spoke with 
Do not use I pronoun. Remain objective.
        some other officers who were likewise interested in the events unfolding on the two rivers and began to notice an unusual pattern. Each person involved in the case came down with an invariable sickness—one that lasted multiple days and ended with a violent fit of mania. I have yet to catch this sickness but find it almost malicious.   
WC. Also, what are you talking about here. Sicknesses are not the focus of this 
article so you should be focusing on the death of the man in Somerville 
EXCLUSIVELY!!
On another note, the bodies definitely came from Long Island. Not the institution, but the lighthouse. I plan on going there soon and investigating myself. In an effort to bring backup, I enlisted the help of Fred Morris of Somerville Police. However, when I asked him to join the search, he refused to speak with me claiming that I “had gone off the deep end.”  
Completely off-topic. Rewrite.  
Alas, Long Island doesn’t allow visitors to stay the night as so I was forced to camp out in the brush off the shore. Nobody saw me. To my surprise, the lighthouse never turned on. The keeper himself must’ve been shot or otherwise killed. “A great keeper lets himself die before the light” the old man once told me. 


When I went inside, the ringing in my ears stopped and my head cleared for a brief moment. It felt euphoric. I found this on the inside wall—


The sea’s conscious of me  
Blowing the horn deep below
The siren call of sailors souls—
fester in salt down underneath. 
Listen, and you’ll here them screech.  


It’s an old song. Old like the bodies that’ve died here. Old like the ones that made ‘em die. So I stayed to listen like the song had told me. I stayed the night. Old westerly winds came and whipped through the light, banging metal against metal and wracking my brain so as to keep it from falling asleep. But, at some point, I cannot tell when—everything stopped.


I heard it. By God, I heard them all. The songs of sailors all sung from beneath the ocean’s muffle! Their throats full o’ salt and water made it sound sorrowful—but the song! It was a beauteous sound to behold! I held my head closer to the water! Closer and closer again! I must hate to admit it but I nearly filled me lungs with salt trying to listen closer! 


Argh! But I barked it all up. I went home. Even now I long for the sound of my brothers. So I’ll go back tonight. Listen to them one last time. You must hear them! I know I must. They sing for us all, and I only need to go a little deeper.

Mentally-ill in Maine


Silence greets me in the white windswept woods.
The city sounds are stifled by the snow.
I tread on rubber soles, attentive to
the brevity of sound this moment holds.
I listen to my breath as I exhale
And watch it fill the divots in the snow.
My heart flutters. Does someone follow me?
I turn around, in part expecting them.
But no. It is my little sparrow perched
Delicately on a branch above.
The little sparrow cocks his head at me
And laughs. His wings stretch and morph grotesquely
Into fingers, forcibly entering
All of my orifices and soft spots.
Brown fingers, gnarled around my neck
Squeeze the air from my lungs, hot sticky sap
Expands, sits heavy in my gut, hardens.
The tree limbs snap. Contort into a cage
Brittle bones, now breaking 
My tears streak red down my porcelain skin.
The sparrows multiply around me
They scream and scream and scream until they stop.
I open my eyes to the empty woods
Displayed on my hospital room tv.

After the Rain


Meandering along the Blue Ridge
As the incessant whine of locusts 
Echoes through the valley


The baked earth and frigid air
Collide.
I watch the steam rise and 
Latch onto my pant legs,
Soaking into the fabric.


I keep thinking you’re here
With me―
A rustling of fallen leaves
The echo of laughter
Deep within the pines.


I nearly saw you
Climbing further up 
The ridge.
You danced along the cliff’s edge


I followed
Because I didn’t want you
To jump.


After all


There’s no reason 
To repeat
A wanton act.


I can feel God pressing on my shoulders
He has knocked me over
And He lays on my back
Unashamedly.


Maybe I deserve this guilt.


I hear a rib crack
I feel myself groan,
But I do not move.
I wait for the moment of escape


I need it to Rain
To have salvation pouring from
The Heavens.
To watch the spirits
Gasp and
Sizzle away,
To no longer
Be haunted by souls
Long gone.


And maybe then
I’ll sigh 
Close my eyes
And scream.

 “Kill me you little shit,” Grandpa Edwardo hissed, arms whipping the spokes of his wheelchair like a blistering treadmill.
“No!” Timothy Jenkins exclaimed, parkouring over empty cardboard boxes and discarded soda cans. He whipped his head back. “I love you pa, I won’t ever kill you for your powers!”
“If you don’t kill me, the other kids will turn you into a laughingstock!” Grandpa Edwardo said. “Little Timmy, the only kid who didn’t have the balls to take his ol’grandpappy’s powers. I rather die of shame than let that happen! This old raggedy body of mine is no use cept to give you a little boost on your way, can’t you see that Timmy? Why, when I was your age, I killed my grandpops and grandma with a good old revolver. Quick, painless, and to the point! Unlike kids these days.”
Spotting a nearby tree, Timothy Jenkins latched onto it and began climbing. “Over my dead body pa. You’re gonna live a dang good life, and pass when the tooth fairy can’t take no more teeth from your mouth.”
“I got dentures you fool!” Grandpa Edwardo said, slowing down. “Don’t you dare take this away from me Timmy. I have waited too damn long for your daddy to get me a grandson and I won’t leave until you have my power.
“Piss off pa!” Timothy said, now out of reach from Grandpa Edwardo’s grasp. “Go get back home and take your meds before you kill yourself.”
Grandpa Edwardo gritted his teeth. “Ungrateful louse.” he said. “Fine! I won’t press the matter further you little bugger. But don’t expect for me to die for you after you see all your friends get real zoomie powers.” Turning the spokes of his wheelchair once more, Grandpa Edwardo sped back to his evil lair.

When the sun shines through
 the glass door  in the kitchen
 around ten  in  the  morning it 
makes     a     perfect     square

I used to lie in the box of light, the warmth of the floor touching my bones.
I’d lie there and watch her familiar movements – the soft opening and closing of cupboards, the habitual cleaning of countertops, returning every so often to her cooling cup of coffee next to the stove. 
She would open the window and turtle dove songs would fill the room, carried in on a breeze so crisp that I could know without looking: oak leaves covered the grass outside. 


Now, there are fruit flies all over the kitchen. 
I stand in the entryway and stare at the floor – the paths worn into those yellow pine boards, the wood stain has all but rubbed away, revealing ghostly footsteps of a figure who exists only in my mind’s eye.
Through the glass, I can see an old windchime in the yard that makes the occasional attempt at music, but the strings are all knotted together; the fall weather has rusted the bells.


A spider in the sill spins its web
         and reminds me that 
I do not live in this house anymore.                 
Someone else has made a home
 of my sunlit sanctuary,                      
and I am trespassing here.

I stick my head into the grass

Searching for
The golden kernels that fall from the stalk,
Clawing as they
Recede deeper and deeper into the soil.


I look up and bob my head,
Fluttering my wings indignantly,
Suddenly aware of your sickening presence.


You horrifying, treacherous thing,
Flapping your arms around,
Your mangled sleeves thrashing in the wind,
The uneven yellow fangs carelessly stitched into your face.
They are bared at me, 
Urging me to flee, 
And yet no sound comes out.


You never speak or yell or curse 
As you should.
You give me a deformed scowl and 
Let the wind sound your growls.


My beady eyes shift from side to side
And I caw at you:
―Why can’t you scream? Why can’t you shriek into the wind?
If you really hate me, 
Prove it!―


I flap my wing disparagingly at you, 
Slapping the hay shooting out from your sleeves,
A sorry excuse for hands.
I hear the hay rustle angrily.
How dare you crinkle those false limbs at me?


―Your entire existence is a fraud―
I squawk at you.
You have no power 
To protect the vegetation that lies behind you.
You simply spread negative energy,
Stifling the vibe with your face,
Like a decrepit clown. 


I shake my feathery black head.
You are a fool, and I am too,
For I have no reason to be speaking to you.


*


The little droplets of melted snow ooze into your
Wrinkled cloth,
Like hopeless tears
Staining the faces of the unloved.
You have been abandoned in the numbing cold,
Left to shrivel like a corpse.
The frostbite clenches down harder than your uneven fangs.
The wind whooshes louder than your crackling sprawled hay.


I land on your torn straw hat
And extend my scaly leg down,
Clawing and grasping at your felt eyebrows.
I tilt the brows upwards,
Turning your scowl into surprise,
Shock and hurt.


I bounce up and down on your threadbare shoulders,
Shaking off the mounds of chilling snow.
I crawl into the gaping hole in your left side
And settle into the tufts of stuffing.


I let out a rattled sigh. 
I guess I can stay here and keep you company for a bit,
But only a few waking hours, and that’s it!


*


The wind has knocked you down
From your post,
And I find you slipping into the 
Chunky spring mud.


This past year
After an ear-splitting shot 
Resounded through the air,
My partner disappeared 
In a cloud of blood and feathers.
Perhaps yours did too. 


I latch onto your pant leg
And pull and heave and sigh,
Dragging you through the slush,
Lifting you into the heavens
And onto a hole-covered roof.


A soft tutting noise escapes from my beak.
I cannot leave you in the cold as I have before,
Or else I know I’ll never find you once more.


Why wallow outside, 
Letting your insides fill with dread,
When you can stay in the barn
With me instead?

Poem for America that regurgitates out of my mouth


They say I am a North American buffalo, 
the kidnapped beast. I held my breath prior, 
and arrived finally at home. 
My muted, wooly, tone-deaf patriotism. That’s the type of buffalo I am. 
The water sources I go to are not the clear, crisp, crystalline ponds of the wild wild west, 
but the blush-pink-beige-khaki-brown paint water left in the cup as you dipped your paintbrush in and out 
savagely as a child 
in the third grade art room. The cheerless, opaque grey that discontented me always. 


The buffalo who saw the emblazoned eagle memorabilia and serpent cynicism and wondered: about the cult of artisans which still ring their golden bells, 
about the witnesses who wear their dry-cleaned white, powdery, button-up shirts full of tetrachloroethylene from the dry-cleaners, yet let their mustard-yellow fledglings perish 
as their ribs and collarbones and ankles are swallowed up, guzzled, and slugged down by its own human carcass.
Rather than give them the bubblegum-pink antibiotic.
Those babes will never know the tang and chalk of the medicinal flavor, 
the big pharmaceutical companies never getting the chance to dance around in their fresh little nostrils, instead their bodies litter the sides of the roads; ribs, red and fat, lay exposed on the 
side of the turnpike like the baby back ribs of a roadkill deer. 


Military surplus stores where the titans of the primal earth would surely die as 
the smell of cobwebs, mustard gas, and molded nylon pricks tears in the down-turned eyes, wrapped up in the hair-dried cellophane of the suddenly shushed voices. 
Almost Americana, yet those uniforms are not real-estate, 
rather: the exoskeletons of their last owners now hanging on the clothes racks 
On sale. 
The masses sent out to fight who later learned they were always meant to be dead. 
The buffalo does not travel far– lingers by home, unable to leave it fully, finds a piece of it everywhere it goes. So brown and full and rich. 
Solid. 
In the wintertime each of its ribs are fully visible. The inside of a baby grand piano. 
The piling feets of snow blocking them from every happiness imaginable, but they do not even realize.
Rather to them, life has dealt them hell. They just keep going.

Finding Wind


Sibilant and relenting,
The wind-wake abates
Around the roadbend,


Its remnants known only
In the shiver of the oak leaves.


A fingerprint of August,
Dusted by the stars,
Lies bare against the evening.


All is exhaled,
And for a moment, is breathless.

Miles and Years


Dark motel rooms are a little like time machines— 
there’s something about being alone 
in that generic, indistinguishable room 
with sheets that are not quite white anymore
after drawing the blinds against the glaring curtain of the sun
that makes me feel like I might be anywhere,
or anyone for that matter, stripping away the years
like so many layers of dirty clothing until I forget
why I am here. Maybe I’m in another hotel room miles and years away 
listening to how my mother’s breath sounds like the ocean 
as she lies on her back, or the room with the shell box 
grinding out white noise to help me fall asleep, 
or the room laden with ocean-scented candles, 
a chemical replacement for that distinct blend 
of salt, sand, and sunscreen. I hold a shell against my ear 
listening to the waves sigh but I found out long ago it wasn’t real, 
just noise resonating between cold, hollow spirals
smoothed by decades spent tumbling in the surf
and to whoever explained away the mystery—
What do you know compared to the true believers?
Those who still put teeth under their pillows at night, 
who haven’t yet discovered the drawer 
in their mother’s vanity rattling with tiny, rotting teeth
smelling one to check if it’s yours, the acrid decay 
making you turn away, and I wish I could take it back,
the wonder of holding the ocean in my two cupped hands,
when I believed my mother’s breath
would be as constant as the tides.

June 26, 1991


Early evening on Kenwood, 
late honey ink of June 
bleeding into July. A smooth quiet
in the house. Me, at my age, 
stepping out to water. Hostas,
magenta dragon snaps, 
roots stained violet.
He’s waiting for me
under the dining room table.
So young.
My sister gave me 
the pillow, 
over my face while
he rapes me, 
ugly, rotten
lemon, latch hooked seams.
Police take
pictures, take
fingerprints, take
underwear–
no, 
my husbands passed–
take the pillow away in a patrol car.
My daughter-in-law calls them 
some weeks later to
get my sister’s gift back.
Thirty years. 
My granddaughter
still calling, 
trying to get it back.

ode to a friend of a friend who won’t remember


she’s perched herself on the bed
sweatshirt over her dress, drenched from the rain
i barely knew her, i barely know her
she’s reading my palm, she’s half leaning over


her friend lays passed out in her lap
happy birthday, twenty-one
i’m fragile, she says, i’m really fragile
but you guys know i’m whole lot of fun


someone has tied their shoes twice in forty-five minutes
all that time and she couldn’t do it once
she was a figure skater in a past life, can’t forget it
she’s very serious about what’s going on


skating on ripped tights and bummed smokes
typecasting everyone from some childhood show
i’ll give her a light if she’ll tell me the meaning
of who i have been, and what i should know

An Appraisal 


Truthfully, this sadness is not worth much.
A couple nickels, maybe, a quarter on a good day, 
sloshing around the bottom of a receipt-littered handbag. 


I’m sorry, reader— 


no matter how many metaphors I weave this sadness into,
it’s only a few yards of fabric, not enough
to make something of it, but I am still sitting down to sew, 
every time imagining what the pain would feel like
if I pierced a needle through my thumb nail.


I’ve done it again, haven’t I? 


Really, this sadness is not worth much. 
Even if I hold it up to light and ask it
to project something sequined onto the wall, 
it’s just a slab of glass that
I’ve been holding onto for too long, 
generating enough pressure for it to splinter
into my palm, to slice
through my life line, and yet,
I don’t seem to bleed.

Honey Trap


Walking to my noon lecture,
I was coming up on a ten-ounce coffee cup, 
lidless, unsupervised on a granite ledge. 
There was a bee– no, two– no, three, 
orbiting the rim, taking turns swan diving 
across the cup’s diameter. They must be competing
for sun-warmed globs of honey hung on the inner walls. 
Parallel to their apparatus now, my view angled inward to see 
bees, at least a baker’s dozen,
a handful of winged Cheerios afloat in baby pink sap. 
What tea is that shade of rose? 
I want to send in the dive team,
but it’s two until the tower echoes twelve.
No honey in there, just a cup 
and a mass grave.

House 
The house was without charm, and it knew it. The front yard – more a collection of dirt and rocks than a lawn – held a rusted metal chair, an ash tray with smoke tendrils climbing out of it all times of day, and two dirty plastic flamingos. One was missing a head. The front window was cardboard and duct tape. The paint peeled badly, as if an open wound from someone picking and picking and picking at a scab. The steps were splintered, the flowerboxes long ago stolen, and the porch railing was missing more wood than it had left. The frame threatened to give a massive creak at any moment, a last word, before cracking apart into a pile of rotting wood to release a cloud of dust up into the sky. 
         Once, long ago, the house had stood tall in its ramshackle but homely self. Nothing special – it wasn’t in a particularly new or nice part of town – but no one had ever been evicted from it and it still had all its major parts. It was the proudest not when it had just been built but when it was battered with the loving destruction accompanying a young family, the last tenants to move in. Two small kids ripped up handfuls of grass when they played outside and drew with markers on its walls. Stains from cooking big meals at family gatherings had soaked permanently into the kitchen ceiling. Water damage was under the tub from when the couple liked to fool in the bath with rose petals from their small garden. The house had been proud of all its marks then. 
The days were differentiated at that time, too. The house knew when it was Tuesday – that was spaghetti night. It knew of Fridays because the children actually received seconds on desserts when they begged, rather than just eye-rolls and “go-to-bed-alreadys.” Saturday, everyone would stay home in the morning, and in the afternoon some of the mama’s friends and their children would come over to play. And Sunday was when they dressed up fancy. The daddy would yell at everyone to “get going, we gonna be late!” but suppressed a smile when the children turned up at the door with mischief. They giggled, believing they’d finally gotten away with it because Daddy played along for a moment, pretending not to notice that Tristan was wearing Ellie’s dress.  
         The mama was the last one out the door without fail, wiping down the mess from breakfast in their kitchen or hanging clothes in the backyard so they would be dry when the family returned. She was always trying to get one more thing done before they left. The house had a special softness for her: she was the one who massaged it with rags and cleaning spray, tickled it with feather dusters and brooms, and shampooed the outside with the hose in the summer. She scooped decay out of the gutters and crawled below the porch to set rat traps. She tended the garden and washed away the dust from the plants’ leaves when she beat rugs outside. Back then, Mama had touched the house with love. 
* 
         The night the phone rang, the house had been creaking softly, rhythmically, while the family slept. Daddy stumbled out of bed, answered, and his face fell as the other end of the line spoke. He held out the phone for Mama, who had padded into the living room after hearing his concerned voice. She took the phone with only three fingers.  
As Mama listened, it was as though something invisible speared through her abdomen. Without leaving a hole or a trace, it doubled her over and sunk her to her knees. She started sobbing and hit the floor with her fist hard enough to make the house to flinch. She dropped the phone and it dangled by its cord, swaying in the air next to her head. Daddy crouched down to drape his arms around her, but with a sudden motion she stood up, grabbed a vase sitting next to the phone base, and threw it against the wall. The house barely felt that blow – it was too shocked. It had never seen Mama like this: screaming, crying, choking. This was not her. The house was at a loss; the only thing it could think to do was creak closed the kids’ bedroom door in hopes they wouldn’t awaken into this nightmare, too. 
         Mama lay on her side a few feet from the shattered vase, crying softly. Daddy tried to comfort her but she waved him away, facing the ceramic shards until he retreated to their bedroom. She struggled to breathe, and her eyes could barely open around the tears that filled them. After too long, her lids stopped trying as she started to fall into a fitful sleep there on the floor. The house made a nearby window swing open a crack. Perhaps a breeze might cool her into calmer rest.  
         Sunlight from the early summer dawn woke Mama only a couple hours later. The house watched her sweep up the leftover destruction. She started to cry again once the last broken piece had been cleared away, once the floor looked as if no vase had ever laid there destroyed. She sat at the kitchen table and stared down at it for minutes, perhaps hours, until the children staggered in with sleep in their eyes asking for breakfast. Her face was glazed as she prepared little bowls of cereal. It took longer than usual, and when she finally gave each child a bowl and a sippy cup, they said they didn’t want their cereal like that, would she make it again but do it like normal? Mama stared at them, confused. The house saw, a moment before she did, that she had poured orange juice into the cereal and milk into the cups – Mama turned away from the children so they wouldn’t see her wipe beneath her eyes before correcting her mistake with painful slowness. 
She lay in bed the rest of the day, although she did not close her eyes. When the other family members slept that night, Mama reversed – rising to go sit outside and chain-smoke on the front steps under the yellow-orange streetlamp glow. After four cigarettes, she pulled on hiking boots from the porch, clunked down the street in the muddy shoes and pajamas, and returned nearly an hour later with dark brown bottles. 
There were never bottles like that in the house, except for when extended family would bring some to gatherings. When they did, there were low, tense exchanges between Daddy and whoever brought it, gestures toward Mama. She never drank from them, but Daddy still checked in on her often. Only once was she not alright: when Tristan had asked for a sip of what Uncle Louie was drinking. Mama had smacked his hand away hard and rushed into the house to sit on the bed, her head in her hands and her fingers tight in her hair. It seemed to the house she had gone far away, and the body sitting there was the left-behind shell. The house had flickered its lights in effort to startle her into coming back, but Not-Mama hadn’t reacted; it was thankful when Daddy had appeared and coaxed her outside again, coaxed Mama back into herself.          So, the night after the phone call, the house was worried that she had brought back six bottles in a cardboard holder. She didn’t open or drink them. Just took them to the bathroom, climbed into the tub, and held one in her hands. Mama traced a finger along its smoothness, bumping it over the ridges of the cap, stroking it. It was as if she didn’t really see the bottle she was cradling, but somehow staring at it was still important. When the sun started to rise, Mama put the bottles under the tub, bunched up a towel around them using her foot, and went to bed.  
* 
         The house’s frame felt shaky the next day. Mama did not get out of bed. It was Saturday and Daddy turned away one-by-one her friends who came to the door. The children brought their mother roses from the garden – she half-smiled, lifted a hand just enough to brush it against their toddler noses, and rolled over, where she stayed for rest of the day. The house watched her lay in the darkness and tried to muffle the sounds of the kids playing elsewhere so she could sleep. But she just stared at the walls, her face unmoving. She had gone somewhere far away again, but this time when Daddy sat next to her for a while, smoothed her hair and asked if she wanted to talk about it, she didn’t respond. Even he couldn’t bring her back.  
Mama rose in the night once everyone was asleep and walked to the bathroom. She stumbled in the dark and caught the railing at the top of the stairs: the newel-post snapped off and the house flinched. Mama didn’t miss a beat, simply brought the chunk of wood to the bathtub, curling around it and the bottles together. It was only a few minutes before she popped the cap off of one with her teeth. The house tensed, unsure of what would happen next. She paused as she raised the bottle to her mouth, looked around at the silence of the AC suddenly shutting off, then closed her eyes and took a long sip. She drank three bottles that night. Each went down faster than the one before. She did not scream again, she did not cry, she did not hit or kick or throw anything at the walls. When she stumbled her way back into the bedroom as the sun began to shine, the bottles tucked back into their hiding spot, the house dared relax and the central air turned back on. Perhaps the bottles weren’t that terrible. Maybe they were even good. 
* 
         The children cajoled Mama out of the bedroom for a few minutes that day. She stood in the kitchen, watching them play in the living room while she slowly ate dry crackers, crumbs falling onto the floor and making the house itch. She dragged her feet through the mess to a bookshelf in the living room and sat on the ground in front of it. Pulling a large book onto her lap, it fell open and the house noticed it was full of photographs. Mama flipped slowly through the pages. Tristan walked by her deep in play, and she wrapped an arm around his waist without warning, pulling him to her suddenly. The boy started squirming, said Mama was squeezing him too tight, but she didn’t seem to hear it. Mama put her finger on one photograph and said softly that was Tristan’s uncle, look how adorable he was at Tristan’s age. The child wasn’t listening and twisted in her arms harder. Daddy walked in and hoisted Mama up, giving the boy a chance to escape, then guided her to the bedroom to help her dress in fresh pajamas. While her arms were raised over her head, he asked her how she was doing, would she please talk to him? She said nothing. Daddy sighed and let Mama fall back into bed.   
* 
         She drank the other three bottles that night. The house thought that would be the end of it. 
* 
         In the morning, Mama rose and dressed herself, not in her normal pantsuits but in an old, loose dress. To the delight of Daddy, she said she was going for a walk. When she returned over three hours later, the house was empty – it realized it was Monday – and Mama came inside with a brown paper bag. In the bathroom, Mama pulled out a single but very large bottle from within, put it under the tub with the soft towel, and walked to the bed. She only rose once it was nighttime, and she drank one-third of it. The house didn’t like the smell that came from within. Daddy, Ellie, and Tristan all emerged from their rooms the next morning dressed in black clothing. Daddy had poked Mama when he woke up, but she had grunted something that sounded like “no, I can’t,” and the other three left without her. Later, Mama sat in the backyard on the grass and cried softly for a long time and smoked. When everyone returned, she wiped her hands under her eyes and went back to bed.  
The children were subdued that evening, and Daddy asked if ordering a pizza would cheer them up? They nodded, asked if Mama would eat with them. He didn’t respond, so they padded into the bedroom. But when they called her name softly from the edge of the bed, she pretended to be asleep. Later, after the pizza had been delivered and they were all eating, minus 
Mama, the house realized it was Tuesday. They had skipped spaghetti night for the first time. 
* 
         Sometime later in the week, the house couldn’t be sure of when exactly, Mama was alone and the phone rang again. The house creaked anxiously as she answered it. Nothing was thrown this time and there was no screaming. Mama simply hung up, went to the bathroom, and drank the last of the big bottle. The house sagged: this was the first time she had opened a bottle in the daylight. And when Daddy climbed into bed that night, she said her boss had called, she was finished, and the house watched him rub his palms into his eyes. Its beams ached for the couple that lay a foot apart in bed – it wished they would hold each other again like they once had. But the next morning was when Daddy found the bottles, and the memory of their old love became even fainter, further away. 
         Daddy was yelling even before he had come fully out of the bathroom. Mama was sitting at the dining room table with her head in her hands. She was silent as he held up a bottle and said why didn’t she come to him if she was hurting so bad? She didn’t move, didn’t respond. The children watched from across the room, and the house had the radiator behind them make the scary noise to send them scampering from the room. Just in time, too, because when Daddy fell quiet, Mama erupted. Something had come unscrewed. Or maybe something had screwed itself tighter inside of her. But either way, she stood up and began screaming at him that he didn’t know what he was talking about, that he didn’t know what she was going through, that he should shut the fuck up already. Mama grabbed her slipper from her foot and threw it at his head. The house watched her elbow Daddy out of the way and felt her slam the bedroom door painfully. 
* 
         The next several weeks continued like this. Mama left the house only to go for long walks. She always returned with a paper bag. She stopped hiding the bottles in the bathroom and kept them right in the kitchen. She moved from the tub to drinking at the dining table each night. 
Daddy would approach her every few days, start out in a gentle voice about needing to get help, about him being concerned and loving her. She would either ignore him or yell, and he’d yell back. The kids would run to the closet in their room, and the house would let a draft slam closed every door between them and the fighting to quiet the terrible sounds as much as it could. 
The day following an argument, Mama or Daddy would apologize and promise to do better. She might go one night without drinking, actually cuddle with him in bed while he slept and she stared at the walls. They even started fooling again, once in a while, usually after Mama asked Daddy to make her feel something. One night, she swung her leg around and sat on top of him, moving so fast and in such hard motions that the bedframe banged violently against the house and left aching marks on its walls that never went away.  
She was in a good mood the next day, only had one drink in the afternoon, and tried to pull Daddy into bed again when he came home from work. He said no, he didn’t like last night, he didn’t want to do it again. Mama raised her voice at him, and he matched her. He turned and marched into the kitchen where the kids were eating an afternoon snack. The house lost power, desperate to distract them out of their fight, but they paused their screams only for a few moments before continuing on in the dark. Daddy began pouring a bottle down the kitchen sink, and Mama shoved him hard and tried to wrestle it away. It slipped from both their grips and shattered. Mama looked up at Daddy for a few seconds, slapped him, then walked out the front door. She kicked the head off one of the plastic flamingos on the lawn. Paying no mind, she disappeared down the street and returned in the moonlight with multiple paper bags. 
* 
The movement out of the house began slowly. Mama’s friends stopped coming and neighbors walked by with fast feet and downturned heads. The children started to sleep over at friends’ regularly. The house couldn’t be sure, but it seemed that they were gone even on weeknights now. Daddy stopped reaching for Mama in his sleep, then moved to the couch, and finally took to sleeping in the kids’ room. Mama spent all her time sitting on an old lawn chair outside, smoking and drinking. The house didn’t mind: she hurt it almost every time she was inside now. It simply watched her sit, from behind a thick layer of summertime dust she was never going to wash off, while the yard became overgrown with weeds and the roses drooped and browned until finally dropping dead.  
One day, after staring at the fallen flowers for a while, Mama got on her hands and knees before them. A cigarette dangled from her mouth and she crawled her way forward with a smaller, dark brown bottle. She lifted it up and slowly tilted it until a thin stream of liquid ran out of it to the base of the bush. Mama let it pour until it was empty, then went into the house and gathered the big bottle and four smaller ones into her arms. Back outside, she drained all of them onto the dead flowers until there was nothing left. That night, Mama went to Daddy, apologized over and over until he finally took her in his arms again. The house let itself relax the next day, settling with noisy creaks in its foundation, when Mama scrubbed her way through four sinkfuls of dirty dishes. Perhaps things would go back to how they were. 
* 
The rose bush never bloomed again, and Mama was drinking from new bottles by the end of the week.  
* 
Eventually, Daddy stopped coming home, too. He said he couldn’t do it anymore, that he was in love with a sick person who wouldn’t get help so he was taking the kids to his brother’s. Mama grabbed one of the children’s wooden blocks and hurled it at him. It missed and went through the front window. The house hardly registered the shattering. It already sagged from the weight of dusty shelves, a roof that leaked on days it didn’t rain, dirty laundry left sitting for weeks, sticky and crumby floors, gutters overflowing with leaves and moss, ants that had taken to the kitchen where filthy dishes covered every countertop. Now, trapped alone with Mama in the cooling weather, the house let its heat give out for two weeks and she came down with pneumonia. It felt guilty but still blew out all the fuses in a stubborn anger when the repairman came to fix the furnace so no work could be done. It made her feel its rainwater tears dripping down the walls and bubbling up underneath the paint. Every once in a while, she would poke one with a sewing needle and the water would release and both Mama and the house would sigh deeply. But then the next day, she would go crashing around with her bottles again, and the house would shake back.  
They were tumbling, locked too tightly together. Neither could pull away as they fell down an impossibly deep spiral. The house was desperate to crash land already, to smack into the bottom and shatter once and for all. But every time it thought about giving out altogether, letting both of them finally rest, it noticed a tear on Mama’s cheek or the corner of her eye looking at the broken frame on the ground holding a photograph of the family from a time when she could still smile. The house watched her hurt and told itself it would just give her today. Perhaps tomorrow would be different. Maybe she would start to change back the next day. It could wait until then. The house could wait one more day. Just one more day.

A Letter from God
Dear Creation №906Б22О1Г, 
I am writing to you today to bring your salvation or as Creation 666 tells me, damnation. But honestly, who believes in 666 anymore? As you hear the words of my vessel, heed them carefully or else great woe shall betide you. Locusts will devour your soul, your girlfriends will dump you, and blah blah blah you know the drill. Jesus, who wrote these God-awful lines? I did? Ridiculous, the vessel must have a speech impediment. Parkinson’s as the mortals call it. Vessel you weren’t recording that correct? You were? Ah, keep it in, it’s not like it matters. 
Anyways, as you probably know by now, I represent as you mortals understand me to be, a God. And as a God, I have nurtured you from the primordial ooze that creamed your planet Terra from the smallest ectoplasmoid implant to the largest hivemind network by at least three universes. I admit, there have been times when you teetered on the edge of extinction. But you breed like to rabbits so than no bubonic plague or nuclear disaster will completely wipe you out.  A little hardship here and there and look at how far you’ve come. To say that I’m proud would be a lie, but I do feel a tickle of satisfaction from time to time. 
Now to the matter at hand. I, the benevolent creator of your mighty universe, have done such a good job in culturing planet Terra that I have been offered many requests to oversee the creation of new universes. I usually ignore those requests because let us be real to a crystalline extent, a God who can’t manage his own pocket universe deserves the eventual decent into chaos of its creations. However, one particular request came from the God whose name is akin to an animatronic door-stopper making love with an eco-sourced toothpick. Such a thought might boggle your puny minds, but it makes mine shiver with pleasure. Door-Stopper-Toothpick-Lover is among the better of the God Architects, and he, it likes to be referred to a he, wants my assistance in overseeing the creation of a new, better Terra. 
He calls it the Better Terra, but I personally think that the naming could be improved. So, it is with minor regret that I have selected you to read this message, so that at least a handful of mortals will know of the situation this fine New Year’s Eve. Don’t call, don’t pray, it will only go to my inbox where it will not be heard or read save some of my angels who have collectively failed to get a life. Seriously, if Lucifer could do it why can’t they? When my work is done. I will return. Either you will be long gone by then, or nothing will seem to have changed. 
Just in case, however, if Door-Stopper-Toothpick-Lover likes my work so much to employ me for eternity, I have called in a replacement God. It calls itself a monster, but I have never seen a monster that also doubles as an Italian culinary dish. No matter, starting 2020 he will take over my position. Don’t worry, everything will be fine. I pre-drafted all the events from 2020 forward and even backed up most of the 1900s in case one of you wily bastards figure out time travel and try to kill Hitler. When the Spaghetti Monster inputs the schematics of predestination, please do leave feedback in some way, perhaps via internet archive or after death. I would love to read about it sometime (not really). 
The Honor is Yours.

The Living and The Dead
        “You shouldn’t smoke,” Giovanni Pontano said, gesturing to the cigarette hanging deftly from his wife Lidia’s lower lip. 
        “What does it matter now?” Lidia said, locking eyes with Giovanni before turning away towards the window. 
        Lidia had been in the Istituto Clinico Humanitas – the premier hospital in Milan – for three months. For the first two months, she seemed to be steadily recovering from whatever mysterious ailment had assailed her one night at the Gheradini’s cocktail party. One moment, she was laughing effusively with the rest of the houseguests, scratching her histrionic itch in a game of charades. The next she was slumped over her armchair, complaining of a fierce headache and begging Giovanni to take her home. Although the Pontano’s never identified the precise cause of Lidia’s illness, it didn’t matter much considering her rapid recovery over the course of two months. That is, until things fell apart.
        About a month ago, Giovanni had been compiling the manuscripts for his debut collection of short stories La Stagione. Day and night, he sifted through the papers strewn about his study and scribbled notes to his editor in the margins. Giovanni’s manic revision process combined with his distracted forays into rereading Dos Passos made him oblivious to Lidia’s worsening condition in the hospital. Eventually, Giovanni stopped answering the phone altogether and the hospital nurse was forced to drive to the Pontano residence herself and bang on the door. Plying Giovanni with the promise of booze, the nurse convinced him to return to the hospital room where he now stood, Negroni nestled between calloused hands, staring at the woman he used to love. 
        The nurse barged into the room, calling Giovanni and Lidia back from their reverie. “How about some music,” she offered. Giovanni shrugged and nodded in Lidia’s direction.
        “No, that’s quite alright,” Lidia said. “I have Gio to keep me company.” She shot a forced smile in his direction and the nurse beamed, smiling widely. 
        “Oh, signora,” the nurse said. “I must say that you and Mr. Pontano make such a lovely couple. I saw your pictures in the papers and, ugh, what I would give to look like that. What was it you were wearing?” she asked with the eagerness of a gossiping schoolgirl. “Dolce e Gabbana? Prada?”
        Lidia looked at the nurse in the same way she looked at the overexcited volpinos of bourgeois dinner parties, the puppies that ate better than half the people of Milan. 
        “It was actually Valentino,” Lidia said. 
        “Valentino?” the nurse said. 
        “Yes, it’s a new house – founded only two years ago.” 
        “One year ago,” Giovanni muttered.
        “What?” Lidia said. 
        Giovanni placed his Negroni on the windowsill and turned towards the nurse and his wife. “Valentino was founded one year ago, not two,” he said sternly. Lidia scoffed and shook her head, a wry smile surfacing on her lips. Giovanni picked up his Negroni, swirled the remaining liquid, and downed it in one loud gulp. 
        “Well, anyways, the clothes were just terrific,” the nurse said, anxious to fill the silence. No one responded so she spoke again. “I mean, that dress Lidia –  che bella. The silk bodice and the lace trim! I would kill for that dress.” 
        “Well, Anna,” Lidia said. “At the end of the day, a dress is only a dress.”
        “People have killed for less,” Giovanni said. 
        Anna laughed nervously and then left the room. Neither Lidia nor Giovanni said goodbye. 


The hospital itself was part of a larger complex that included two identical condominiums, an office building, and a mall. Directly across from the hospital was a six-story shopping center. Beside it were the rubbled remains of the church torn down to make space for this concrete edifice. Metal scaffolding snaked up the sides of the shopping center and men in hard hats scampered along metal beams holding drills, saws, and hammers. The din of metal-on-metal could be heard even over the steady thump of the fan that puttered ceaselessly above Lidia’s bed. 
        Although the cement blocks of the shopping center were varying shades of brown, Giovanni and Lidia were alike in seeing the shopping center as utterly colorless. As if by asphyxiation, the once-vibrant colors of the streets below lost their luster with the increasing altitude. Wisps of moped reds and navy peacoat blues yielded to the brutalist blocks of gray cement that towered like smokestacks over the cities of the plain. 
        The walls of Lidia’s room were also gray and the room itself was sparsely furnished. In addition to the bed, there was a ratty couch in the corner and a nightstand upon which sat Lidia’s medication and a glass of water. The only items adorning the walls were a couple painting reproductions, a calendar with pictures of various tourist sites of Rome, and an analog clock. When the hour hand struck four, there was a knock outside. Lidia said “come in” and Giovanni didn’t say anything. 
        A man in a creme dinner coat and light blue linen shirt walked in. He was a couple inches taller than Giovanni and about five years younger. A pair of wayfarers fit snugly in his breast pocket and furls of chest hair peaked over the top buttons of his shirt. Despite coming from his day job in the banking district, he looked perfectly suited for a summer holiday on the Amalfi Coast, his blonde hair tousled in a sun-baked heap. 
        “Ciao Lidia!” he said, thrusting his arms around her in a warm bear hug. “Oh, if you only knew how worried I have been, how many sleepless nights I have spent anxiously awaiting sweet dreams of you.” 
        “Paolo!” she said, clearly flustered. “What are you doing here?”
        Giovanni poured himself another Negroni and feigned composure. Truthfully, he was sizing up Paolo and speculating about his relationship with Lidia. Compared to Paolo, Giovanni looked decidedly plain. He wore a slim-cut suit with a thin black tie clipped to his shirt. His wire-rim glasses were perched precariously on his slender nose and – combined with his severe bone structure, beady brown eyes, and austere comb-over – lent him an almost-avian appearance. Perhaps their most significant divergence in identity, however, was with regard to their respective careers – Giovanni was a sensitive intellectual whereas Paolo was an accomplished financier, a practical man’s man. 
        “Yes,” Giovanni said coldly, “turning from the window. What are you doing here?” 
        “I heard Lidia was sick, and I rushed here at once,” Paolo said. Neither Giovanni nor Lidia looked at each other. Both remained silent. Paolo hesitated and his brow furrowed, revealing a mixture of equal parts consternation and amusement. The fan continued to putter weakly overhead, its screeching whines drowned out by the noises of heavy machinery from out the window. “Darling,” Paolo said, gazing tenderly at Lidia. “Have you not told Giovani about us?”
        Lidia lit another cigarette and sighed. “What does it matter now? Love’s lifespan is only as long as its beholders, no?”
        “Is that your own line?” Giovanni said. 
        “No, it’s yours,” Lidia said. Giovanni grunted but did not speak. “From La Stagione, don’t you remember?”
        “La Stagione!” Paolo said. “I didn’t you were the Giovanni Pontano. I’m a fierce admirer of your work, signore.” Paolo extended a hand towards Giovanni, but Giovanni did not shake it. 
        “That’s some consolation for sleeping with my wife,” Giovanni muttered. 
        “What was that?” Lidia said. 
        “Nothing,” Giovanni said. “It was nothing.”
        Lidia shrugged and returned to smoking her cigarette while Paolo stood awkwardly between them. He started whistling.
        “Uncomfortable with silence?” Giovanni said.  
        “No, not particularly,” Paolo said. “I just enjoy music.” 
        “Music is the exception to the rule, my friend,” Giovanni said. “We are surrounded on all sides by a vast, impregnable silence. And its walls close tighter with each passing day and second. It’s as if we’re butterflies ensnared in a spider’s tightening web.”
        “I don’t follow.” Paolo said. “Are we the butterflies?”
        “We used to be,” Lidia said wistfully. “When we were young and beautiful.”
        “Were we ever that way?” Giovanni said. 
        “I think so,” Lidia said. “A long, long time ago.”
        The smell of sawdust from the construction permeated the room and caused Paolo to stop whistling and cough. Lidia smoked her cigarette and Giovanni sipped his Negroni. 


Paolo was forced to leave a couple of hours earlier and return to his wife and family so as not to arouse suspicion. Meanwhile, Lidia’s condition had worsened dramatically. Her olive skin had whitened to a corpselike pallor and, regardless of how many blankets she nestled under, she was still shivering uncontrollably. Flies and moths circled above her in anticipation, occasionally diving down to suck the perspiration from her sweat-laden locks of auburn hair. She dabbed her forehead with a handkerchief, but the beads of sweat kept trickling down like the droplets on a tea kettle. 
Around suppertime, Anna brought in some fruit – dates, apricots, and grapes – and nuts – cashews, pecans, and almonds – as they were the only foods Lidia could stomach in her ailing state. 
“Do you need anything else?” Anna said. 
“No, I’m fine, thank you,” Lidia said. Anna smiled and turned to leave. “And Anna,” Lidia called after her. 
“Yes, Ms. Pontano?” Anna said. 
“Thank you so much for your help.”
“Of course. It is my pleasure.” Anna turned to leave, but, this time, Giovanni stopped her. 
“Tell us, Anna,” he said. “Are you married?”
“No, Mr. Pontano,” she said. “I’m not, but I’m engaged to be married to a law student at the university. He wants to one day be a writer like you.” 
Giovanni stroked his chin pensively and nodded. “A writer, hmm,” he said. “Well, that’s terrific. I only have one piece of advice for you, Anna.” 
“What’s that?” she said. 
“Don’t marry him,” he said. 
“Giovanni!” Lidia said sternly. “Don’t speak to Anna like that.” 
Giovanni was pleased. He had Lidia’s attention for the first time that day. “What was it Dickinson said? Tell all the truth but tell it slant. What pitiful advice. Tell me the truth, Lidia – the unslanted, unadulterated truth.” 
“I don’t love you anymore,” Lidia said softly. “I may have once but that was a long, long time ago.” 
“But you love Paolo,” Giovanni said, his jowls flapping, face reddening. “Say it. I know you do.”
“Giovanni, please,” Lidia said. “Let’s not do this in front of Anna.” 
“Basta! Don’t patronize me.” He turned to Anna. “Anna, vada via.” Anna bowed quickly and scurried out of the room. 
“Happy now?” Lidia said. Giovanni didn’t say anything. “And, no, I didn’t love Paolo. I haven’t loved anyone since I died. And I died a long, long time ago.” Lidia coughed up blood, the red blotches staining the white linen sheets. 
Giovanni didn’t move to help Lidia and instead merely gestured to the sheets saying, “They’ll think I stabbed you.” 
“Would that really be so bad?” Lidia said. “If my life can’t end in ecstasy, I’d rather it end in agony. Leave behind something for the poets to write about.” 
“I don’t think I’ll write about this,” Giovanni said. 
“Why not?” Lidia said.
“Because I feel nothing.”  
Lidia laughed and started gasping for air. Then she fell silent. Giovanni shook her and she didn’t stir, so he took the cigarette from her fingertips and left the room, a spectral cloud of smoke in his wake.

for your consideration


I offer it up,
bloody and vital,
onto your butcher’s block


Cut into it. Tear it apart. 
Maybe in the autopsy
you’ll find something true. 


You can discard it if not.
But if you do,
save a morsel of it. Save two. 


I wish I could offer more:
something beautiful, 
something concrete. 


But all I have is 
a pound of flesh;
A pound of paper.


In red ink,
hesitantly, I write,
“for your consideration”
