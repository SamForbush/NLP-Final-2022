"The lamp casts a full moon on the ceiling 
Coiled snake among the ashes on the desk
Stands guard as we face each other. 
Silent shadows on empty walls 
We dance eye to eye 
Your transylvanian eyes 
Green pits that descend to a black hell 
And I follow them willingly, 
Craving the pomegranate. 
You hold my face between two claws 
(so much like hands, by day!) 
The blood spurts Lethean rivulets 
Plunge down my cheeks warm wine 
Curdles in the crevices of parched, parted lips 
Choking and soothing, flowing over 
White bodies, white sheets, 
And these cool marble claws 
Rock and cradle me in the snake's light. 
Tongues meet swollen, and tasting blood 
Man-eaters, tangling, touching . . . slow 
Circles. Ritual dances performed, 
and the sacrifice is made. 
I feel you swallow and suck me dry."
"Osage orange 
next to the meta sequoia , 
do you remember? 
in a diamond web 
taut between upright palms 
this once from a child's memory, 
an Apache door 
opens into hard green fruits 
hanging in the mellow afternoon, 
autumn's air left wisps of frost 
clinging to silent movie lips 
and hovered on the hillside 
above the railroad tracks. 
fragile crystals penetrated 
the clear blue sky, 
and the larches wept."
"Moon shadows: 
Winter ghosts across 
Clean white naked Snow. 
Orion stands tall Against the frozen sky, 
Haunting A hungry earth. 
Guilty eyes Compassion pleading 
As squirrel Makes his getaway. 
An empty bottle drops. 
Cold's steel fingers clutch 
The empty hand The frozen soul. 
Trees' branches 
A thick black lace 
Cage a glowing crystal Moon."
"The grumper
dog sniffs
and paws
for scraps
of chicken salad
or mayonnaised tuna
in the lunch room.

His red-rimmed
eyes searching
for food
to fill
the black pits
of his brown
blotched body."
"At night,
though,
the grumper dog
escapes from the rusted
hunger blade
that
at his stomach
by pondering
at the blue-black
night speckled
with stars, and
dancing with the
silver-grey moonfish
with the cobalt-blue eyes."
"Inside the
molared mouth
of the beast
with the black
belly
filled with
brown beer,

a man
with a
white scar
on his face
clings to the beast's
sticky pink tonsil,
wet with saliva,
so he won't be sucked
into the beast's black abyss."
"he stands alone
Eyes shifting from one to another
back to the original one,
Hair covering his ears,
his eyebrows
Until at last
he clears his throat
allows his eyes to well with tears
and cries
leaning over the podium accusingly.
Your description, he demands,
be accurate.
Your attitude, uncomfortable."
"An act of grace, you insist upon reminding me
your love not quite real enough
dripping down the edges,
drying hard, sticking in the corners
like this morning's poached egg in the cup.
The afternoons of summer
we spent indoors in small over-crowded restaurants
silently hoping it would rain.
We would so knowledgeably speak of
Women and men
dismissing (or only parenthetically including)
our own encounters
with the rest of the species.
We laughed more then
in our days of perturbed seriousness;
I think we just stayed drunk more
imagining September would never arrive,
you would never have to work,
I would never go off to school.
And now, in the middle of quite possibly
the coldest winter in years,
I ache to share the fine lines of your face
set against the imaginary rain."
"Through the fear-bank chill of morning,
Head turned forever on the right shoulder,
He stumbles exhaling truncated bodies of steam.
Eyes a-gog in his stubble-red face topped
With hair blown ragged-rickshaw.
Hands pocketed, hidden like little rodents.
His coat the corduroy relic of someone gone.
It is tied closed with the shoestrings of tennis shoes.

He shuffles on shoes attached like wooden blocks
To his bony crumbum legs. Moving slowly.
Past the fogged windows of the laundromat,
Past the pizza house, the donut shop, the fire station.
He crosses the lower streets of Beacon Hill where
They empty onto Cambridge, stark and gaunt
As the lights change. Taxis sound their horns
And drive through red lights en route to noontime.

Outside the door of a nondescript bar
The homosexuals gather unashamedly.
They feed him with handouts and offer up
A daily pint of sundown. He seldom strays
Far from this source of nourishment and oblivion.
Only on his better days does he take the transit
To Harvard Square, to stand among the crowd and stare
At the musicians, magicians, and clowns.
"
"Given to fits of coughing, fits of spasms in
The neck that cause his head to lurch.
Bottom jaw protruding, mouth gaping as though
He has just received the news, the bad news.
He holds out his hand as someone passes,
And then stands looking at his hand
Wondering, ""Is it mine? Has it always
Been there? It looks so small"
"Crossing the footbridge to the Charles,
To sit on a bench in the evening chill.
Looking over the water, to be lost in
The lights of the far shore, as in summer
He used to watch the sailboats without focusing,
Until his thoughts would drift as though they too
Had surrendered to the wind and water.
As thoughtless and as serene as the breeze "
"The endless traffic on Storrow Drive.
The Rapid Transit crossing Longfellow Bridge.
The sirens of rescue units periodically
Slicing the night into slivers. Mass General
Listens for them like a mother for her children.
The roar of fire engines backing into the station.
Skytowers, the mountains of architects, rising
From the streets, a majestic maze."
"The Wind shouts its winter message into
The ears of The Night with a blast.
The Night harbors the dread, spiny
Cold within its awesome darkness.
The jagged Cold strikes at the
Boundary of Life, warm skin, easily pierced.
A man on a bench, in the city, his smallish whispers,
Half-frozen, clinging to his beard like candy."
"the fallen tree jutted
into the silent lake
timid summer leaves clung
to intact branches on the shore.
directed mockery to bleached
cracked branches. empty twigs.

their tone would change
as surely as shifting moonlight
touched the barren branches,
water caressed half-sunken roots,
circlets were formed by raindrops,
and the advent of an early frost;
orange, red, gold,
flushed, they'd walk on water
ignorant of the cold,
and withered brown, the moon
through empty branches would chide
the last brittle scraps."
"For a while, studying the ashtray,
I silently composed notes
Which would have been more accurate,
But the faces behind the woodwinds,
in contortions, made me smile
And the strangers discussing
The physics of Music
So Seriously
Below the harmonious and discording bass
Were so smugly off-key
That delight at being frivolous
Exploded my tongue
And I had to laugh out loud."
"The Susquehanna River flooded one summer
while I was gone
And when I got back everything was dry
Only branches and tree trunks hanging from the
drawbridge bottom
And Huckleberry fishing as usual

Thirty-five feet of water and the marks still
there
One man drowned on Main Street
And the frogs talking like it never happened"
"Mother, our souls look from the same eyes
Uneasy calm, like weather that cannot make up its mind
Reflecting generations of rage and Celtic sorrow

Handed down, mother to daughter, our heirloom jewels;
Passion shone through amber bottles and misty dawns
Mother, our souls look from the same eyes.

We love, like sisters
we hate, like rivals. We turn away
Only to turn back, startled to see ourselves in each other
Reflecting generations of rage and Celtic sorrow.

On a castle wall in Cork a tapestry tells our story
In threads of stale beer, curses, screams, and prayers
Mother, our souls look from the same eyes

And then look away, denying the history

of passion and pain

Etching discontent in a notebook with our hearts in our eyes
Reflecting generations of rage and Celtic sorrow.

We bear the same name
carved into family gravestones
And into us, an ancient blessing and an ancient curse.
Mother, our souls look from the same eyes
Reflecting generations of rage and Celtic sorrow."
"The wolves are on the snow again,
Wolves running gray,
Running moonlighted under black boughs of pine
That fuse together,
Silent and gray,
The sparkling snow parting beneath them,
Smoothly through the stark whites and shadows,

and with them;

Furrows behind, silent but for wolvish breath
And the snow parting sliding,
Animal plans in view
Under the black crystal air and the moon."
"from the mist valley of morning we come,
two men, two boys, in the dew-beaded grass,
slipping from the folds of fog like sheep in the low pasture.
we come, climbing a drain-bed of rocks on the hill,
dry hands on dry stones sloping in the cold sunlight
past daisies, buttercups, and blackberry brambles;
the footprints of deer at their stubborn roots
crowd the pipeline leaning toward the old gas well.

here, in the high hilled field left unfenced,
overgrown behind a curtain of woods,
some solitary shard of metal stabs the rutted field;
rust brown pipes, cables, shaft choke

the abundant weeds

the boys carefree play while the men pause to watch,

here,
clutching the fulvous tractor welded by the years
to the ground, the stones, the weeds, pipes, rigging,

unmoved.

resting under the umbrella of wires
in the shadow of the pitched upright shaft,
at bailing time, the boys having played

at the ""warship's mast""

and listed leeward into the billows of fog,
chase the morning's first butterfly down the meadow,
the men hear their laughs fade in eager awaiting,
fire the keen edge of morning with dry pistons' groans
that motor the bail's winch, driving the mute steel deep."
"down, through the high rutted altar of earth,
the tall grass no longer bowed in prayer,
the field incensed with daisies, buttercups, and black-

berries;

deep drives the bail into the black wound of the earth,
come to the cold water seepage of her dark womb
to suckle at the field's weeds' roots' draughts beyond reach,
drawn sunward by the mute steel, the cold flows uncaped
spill over the flat stones suppliant in the morning sun
torrent down the meadow, down the drain-bed of rocks
sweeping toads' clutches of sunhot rocks past boys' cheers
blackberries footprints of deer wisps of rolling fog
rush of the curtain of woods shadows flash
into the low pasture through the folds of sheep

come to drink

in the valley's stream, now from the wave of sunlit draughts

beyond reach.

at the foot of the brambles the boys play,
shouting until the noon pull of the winch
brings the brimming long pipes upward to the

sunwarmed hill-

side,

the men lay them against the wet rocks;

where weary,
the last water trickles between stones in silence,
the boys wonder at the sudden heat of day;
from the shaded bank a toad emerges to bask."
"I am the curator,
For an eight-year-old ornithologist
Collecting seagull
No expert of any age could know better
What each bird really thinks
Or why it left its feathers there
She runs around me in concentric circles.
Returning to thrust her treasure into my hands
Until I have a fistful of feathers
A little girl’s fantasy
Held for a moment
In her father’s hand."
"Today at dusk I drove
Until the sun was all but swept away.
The skyline was folds of pink over purple.
Below in the valley headlights pursued
Endless streams of red glare along the highway
Which sways between the darkened hills to the west.

In the dim light I stopped
At Dove Lake, knowing well that her memory
Would follow me as I made my way
Across the frozen water,
Past the stone remains on the far shore.
Dove Lake. Windswept but not desolate.
I will be back.
"
"Friday night, waiting out

in a club

Eyes searching the ice cubes in her own

or other drinks,

The black and white striped lady
Strapless dress thrown barely over her chest
Large Pink flower behind her ear
Is out of place among the dungareed.
Aching to play out a new desertion,
Jessica, eternal Dido, courts her phyre.
She is too obvious,
Too intense in her pursuit,
Her questions hurled after departed Aeneas
only aid his flight
Fire melts her,

Jessie waits for Death."
"Or maybe, running in boredom past limits,
She has not yet reached despair.
She only fills these hours
Waiting for the presents of
Eternal Christmas parties.

Waiting for Christmas,
Waiting for Death.

Jessie waves at
the band."
"Li Wang Tao tossed sticks to the wind,
they floated like butterflies
and scattered in the flowers,
jasmine petals scented the air,
in the pungent loam lay the sticks."
"Great Master bows to the breeze,
gathers lines on his knees in the dirt:

— hsien. tui rests over kan.

above the mountain water lies.

she seeps into creeping plants,
for fruit,
her mouth and tongue thirst
aching to climb the many jointed tree
the sorceress turns concubine.

lily pads drift on the quiet pond,
beneath the water small rocks sit.
the tortoise stirs the mud."
"one moves his great toes,
alone they flounder without will;
feet glide along silk calves.

the cleft white lotus parts,
in the softness heave red berries.

he abides quiet
in his place,
below the sacred gingko tree
she tastes the fleshy nuts.

tender thighs press into the cool stream,
the smooth stones are firm.

she touches skin over the spine/heart,
many circles ripple the water;
the rock sinks complete.

the tortoise glides through the pond,
complacent joy swallows the grass."
"but Li Wang Tao, said Ku Wan.

the tortoise shell is a withered bone;
the divining stalks are so much withered grass,
why not listen to yourself
instead of seeking from the wind?"
"Quieter towers translate European anguish
The hall holds subdued female voices,
Pairs of hands click over the fire,
Forging the evening’s meal.
A watching beauty turns from the grille,
The sun rays onto her dark head
Newly untouched.
Noble daughter, nobly wed,
Sojourn for a hero,
The assurance of his passing.
The husband stranger departed at morning
With the peace of shadows behind him.
The daughter’s feet click the stones
As she moves toward the half-women.
The tongues of fire enthral her.
They are like bubbles of blood."
"“He’s so sensitive.”
They could say it and say it.
And it wouldn’t mean a thing.
Their lives are cluttered, hard enough, and sad enough
Without your fears which you wear like a mantle,
if you don’t know it.

These pauses you lapse into
I remember when your music was your refuge
It would fill the house
like a stream of liquid gold.

Nods, smiles and frowns. How were we to know
that you were piling, no, filing them away,
like so many references.

You haven’t played in years
After a time, you were afraid to move,
Afraid of making a mistake

Think about the time when you could live inside your songs,
When you were famous,
certain as the day was long,
Until your thoughts grew silent
And the music ceased
Before your wondering,
What were the strengths
What were the weaknesses"
"That night, learning to dance,
colliding with strangers who
shed their strangeness with the
first fast song, the soundness, the
safety, in the loud music, silent
thoughts finally allowed to be spo-
ken, but unheard over the rock and
roll poems, stereo heartbeats pumping
vitality into fainted bodies, sheb
lacked mouths brushing sideburns,
and decapitated heads of cigarettes
still burning in an ashtray"
"The reservoir mirror unripes early morning;
Cats cloud behind me.
The duck family flows the current green bodied
in fish brightness.
5:00 A.M.
It is peace
Until the anger surges
Ripping me in its path
Making necessary the ritual sacred to morning.
Here on the low bank,
Waiting
Holding the nerves flat against my stomach
Fumbling with the surprise of my body
For new eyes.
To hear her scream,
To see her running,
Long steps across a neat shaded grass
Glinting the cool sun in her long hair,
Brings the explosion of myself in myself,
and the spilling of wrath
All over.
Morning is my time of day
Low sun on the tinging water
Upside down ducks floating
Calmly touching waves.
It is peace."
"I hadn’t expected you
On a rainy night
I was turning in a nightmare
Shivering in my sleep
Rain dropping on the windowsill
Spattering moisture on the bed.
I awoke to a pellet in my brain
To hear something fiddling with the lock
I was frozen in the light of the clock
Gasping to turn the alarm in my head
Noise scattered from the alley
A clinking on the fire escape
A rustling in the garbage cans."
"A strange creature who gnaws at the door
He will break into your adrenaline
He will stab you if you move
You are just another breakfast
He walks with an axe
To the edge of your bedroom
Swinging at any sound
Loving the scare in your eyes
Melt into the blood on the floor
It drips with the rain
Trailing through the cracks in the wood
The rivers dry in the wind."
"Then I heard the bolt turn
And footsteps whisper from the hallway
A muffled silence in the fidgeting
I could feel you in the doorway
You stood for minutes watching
As 1 lay motionless in the bed
A shadow on the clock
In the grey of my eyes
You now stood over me
You could see my eyes twitch
Then you spoke."
"the woman, standing behind the screen door,
looks somehow older than the last time I remember her;
older, or perhaps just tired.
Her hands wait to push the screen open
until I reach that top step,
an action she has followed
from as far back as my life reaches.
Sometimes we sit for hours, trading
Lives; her eyes become young again
and the hands that used to soothe
my headaches,
fly in every direction.
then, we both subside,
each becoming silent and inanimate.
Rising to leave, I lean;
she looks tired again,
pushing the screen open to let me out.
Sometimes, I wish she would let herself out instead."
"Is it only one year?
Shall I ask that question
Of which we never seem to tire
Shall I repeat last year’s lies
What shall I say?
Shall I address you as “My Dear’’
Shall I say My Dear
I have lived
More or less each day
Too much like the one it followed
With everything the same
Is everything the same?
Shall I say the plants
Have all grown an inch
And we are all thankful
To have another year survived
Shall I close with my love
Cross the t’s and dot the i’s
And sign my name"
"Near the apple leaves
In the corner of Schmitts’ yard
There are red roses
On an old knotted fence

The fragrance would linger
To our windowsills at night
It would stop my mother
And she’d listen
To the apples dropping
To the clustered grass.

And in the morning
We used to collect them
So the grass would stay green
Bees could stay in the compost.

One incandescent morning
Sapless and moist
I climbed the tree
The bees circling the apples
Like wavering planets
As the sun bore down on the red
Of my cider glazed tongue.

When the moon settled into the sky
I watched the apples turn purple
Their punctured skin like the cratered
Edifice of the face I dreamed I knew.

An urge filled me like an unconquerable
Appetite on honeysuckle afternoons
1 climbed to pick five loose apples
That dropped to my palm at touch
I rolled spastic in the grey grass
Soaking the moon into my soul
And then one by one, I hurled
The fruit to the white eyebrows
A spin of color then a lulling thud
On the roof of Lindenmeyers’ greenhouse
And not a light came on in the neighborhood
But mother was listening from the sill."
"my love grows
the unnamed object
on the periphery is slanted toward the sun
the pebbles blanket
the three plants
that slant toward
my East side
I wake to find that it has browned
1 use the brittle leaves for fertilizer
With ceremony, I spread it around the soil.
I thought that touching African violets was a sin.
New day, new watering
can I go to fill it
you turn to me
and ask that the blinds be drawn
slowly,
drip on the leaf
the green leaf
that waits to be touched
I propose a cover for the unabashed glass."
"in the twilight a thrush rose from the thickets
to mock solitary scarecrow and vagabond alike.
he buried tears in a careworn leather hat
hand stitched, scratched, sunk on a fencepost,
or fingered stubble on his chin in the cooling air,
wind chaffing straw from a limp, wet hand,
scattering it haphazardly across the nearby fields,
through the grass and into the hardening shadows.
the reflection in the pond might have shown
the old bay, Nellie, tossing her head
whinnying at perspiration, the evening mist
and the young man watching her big brown eyes.
she nuzzled his cheek, his hand impatiently, stamped.
she saw the scarecrow’s telltale broomstick flecked with gold,
turned, and rambled to the derelict fence
bringing on his last flood of tears."
"the sun beats down
you are too good to leave me
Rays try to bake my flesh
worn with loving you at midday
Seaside quarrels turn your head
toward the dunes
that I long to lie in and plow

down the avenue of sand
1 go accompanied by a blue cape
the gulls clap
my presence a sun unto itself

high tide
nude and alone
the clam shells crowd me
I cry out and the radio
responds with a small craft warning"
"Purple Pussycat barefooted
throngs of thongs
red, yellow, pink sun bleached
hair and suits minus strings
eat out, eat in, be comfortable
while you swim
jellyfish dancing and mouths chewing
in rhythm
two dozen steamers and
a mug of beer"
"1 cry over torn awnings
my tears and the salt water one
cables unhooked
you turn to me and I am gone
one part of me, sun-sensitive,
broke off and disrobed
the other, leaning forward to
catch the echoes before they sound"
"And as the wind rippled away,
Toward gouges and fuzzed ridges,
The cold still grey breath fell,
And the crow loosed the hold.
He seemed to flow away,
To the softer mists on the back hills."
"Thus it ended: not with a whimper
nor with a bang,
but a neat and sudden stop.

Autos died like wind-up toys,
rotating signs ground to a halt,
subway echoing dissipated
through the tunnels beneath the city.
Manhattan’s blazing Babylon towers
blinked off like Christmas tree lights
as if someone had tripped on a wire somewhere
and pulled the cardinal plug.

The skyline vanished
into the ink-black sky
and a velvet curtain of silence fell
to mark the Grand Finale.

It came like the flash of a sword
that cut a clean but fatal wound,
leaving no time
for even a hurried prayer.

The sun arose on schedule
in a cloudless virgin sky
above mountains of rusted steel
and crumbling granite.
Deep in the valleys

all that moved were the dandelions
that split the Park Avenue pavement
and the scavenger pigeons
that roosted or walked
precisely where they pleased."
"daft,
like some fragile flower you had known.
Virginia Cowslip, bluebells tossed in the wind,
you watched the rises of fish in the river,
nodding blossoms laughed in her hair
and mockingbirds spread their wings in the grass,
white bands flashed in the twilight,
she picked a pinkish cup for you."
"it bloomed again,
soft human colors and shortened hair,
your hand touched a moist, bowed cup,
fragrant petals broke in your palm
and the moonlit grass whispered its solace,
sorry in the night you shivered,
dropped the bluebells in the river
and watched them float away."
"We sit and stare, across from each other. 
On occasion you wipe your red pencil eyes 
With a soiled handkerchief brought slowly 
From your old, unstylish, too long, brown robe. 
We sit, suspended, thirteen floors above. 
Was it luck or irony for this ward? 
In the elevator, Mother marveled, 
And speculated on what grim comment 
You must have made when the light stopped moving. 
The table pays Thirteen, only thirteen. 
The croupier orderly took all your clothes. 
Gambler, you played so long, you had to lose. 
We are locked in each other’s company, 
The door is locked, the screens are bolted shut."
"He remembers just the dank chill 
Of all those Sunday mornings 
When they’d rise in the dark and still 
Shivering, pull the rough stitching 
Of oft-patched cloth over legs 
Thin-shinned and itching. 
Father’s snore from the couch 
Rang deeply through the kitchen: 
A sour-east Mass bell 
Calling all to elbow at the tap, 
Splash icy water in cracked brown mugs 
A feast before the Sacrament: 
Urged through leaden streets to church, 
The dull swish-clack of heels on gray cobblestone 
Clapping like rosary beads. 
He still walks home from work: now 
Down seamless tarred streets 
Where the evening traffic sounds 
Tally out the daily bread; 
He turns in to the frontwalk, 
To sunblanched porch and supper’s content. 
He spends secular evenings 
Watching Kojak with the wife, 
At the bar with friends’ creased faces 
Feeling the bright brass clank of 
Hard, shined coins in public places 
The bump of calloused elbows at the taps. 
Dreams are pressed now from foreign sidewalk’s cement 
And memories swish-and-clack 
Discreetly, without lament."
"the moon stares down
ere it departs
and rips
the gathered calmness

fleshIess head
leering through
a mask of black

tree talons
amorphous shapes
their shadows
lurk uncast

the path
is turgid red
still glittering

sanguine shrouds
stagger down
feast on succulent gangrene

Kiss thy silver, Judas,
you will pay the price."
"And now there are October winds, blown down
from the Northwest, raking the land

(from the lake towns, the bordertowns,
from the lonely fishing towns,
across the sad fields of Quebec;
carrying, heaving the flat bluebottom
clouds along, and the singing geese)

The crying birds desert the river
Along the river the sentimental wind
moves, assaulting the ancient land,
stripping, at
last disclosing
A view of the city by night.

A view of the city by night,
itself disclosing
corners and crevices and funnels of refuse
and vast darknesses; emptinesses in the solid land,
And in the streets its children,
in the night the hungry children
empty against the wind."
"There is no wall
but the sheets of corrugated
metal bolted together and overlapping
in rusted patches like quilt work.
There is no river
but the river of men and women
in tents along the concrete
overpass with platitudes
like esperanza y fe
chipping away with the old paint.
There is no sanctuary
but the policia munipical
who set fire to the canal
like an exterminator
flushing out rats with heat.
There is no respite
but a clean needle under your skin
so sharp you don’t even feel it.
There is no God
but the statue of Christ
larger than life
arms open
glaring down from the highest hill
with so much fire in his
one good eye."
"Where are you going in such a hurry?
In those pre-dawn hours when the sky
is an indiscernible gray, and the sun
hasn’t burned off the morning fog just yet—
the drop-off into the canyon below
a sea of white concealing the dry brush
now heavy with dew, and if you
stepped off that rocky ledge—
you’d step off the edge of the world.
Is that where you’re headed?
You pass me without a glance, another
two-legged beast shuffling into their
metal boxes, a loud, clumsy creature—
unlike you, gliding through the fog
on padded feet, the perfect cones
of your ears perked up to the slightest
sound. Not a common backyard dog,
no, you have too much pride, too much
of the wild in you, as you slip into the
fog and take that next step
into the empty white, trusting the ground
to rise up and meet you."
"The molten mercury flows
from a thousand tiny holes,
bulldozing each nerve it touches,
just as lava plows a mountainside.
My flesh singes and steams,
two shades redder than it should be;
through the shampoo, I can
almost smell my burning skin.
Time passes differently in a warm embrace,
slower, like syrup, oozing on by as
I stand and watch, feet glued to
the ground, a hymn on my lips.
I’ve been in the shower for years, and
the water is slowly losing steam."
"On the backstreet
outside the American
backcountry tourist town
filled with motels—
hotels appear not
invented there— neither do
storied buildings, since replaced
by storied buildings
You wonder do I
fear the car stolen
or only my stuff?
Not caring for things
It lies unlocked; You
walk off exploring
histories: nothings.
but one time right there
something was—
it matters
only to those that care."
"Poke, prod, Prick!
That’s what you say I do,
and that’s what you call me,
my love.
You think me a cactus,
concocting conundrums,
yet I only want to share
my sweet fruit with you.
My glochids are no danger,
I promise you, darling,
so stroke them softly, and
see they’re smooth as silk.
Don’t apply pressure, though,
lest you wish to be punctured;
maybe the pair of us are just
too prickly for peace."
"Often times I wonder
what a bullet would taste like.
I think it must taste like
silver, like
the The End! card of
an old silent film.
Or maybe ashy,
like the jet black firewood
left behind in a pit
long since extinguished.
Perhaps it’s like
a used dry eraser, filled
with chemicals and carcinogens
from words so unwritten.
I wonder how a bullet tastes
at eight hundred miles per hour."
"See here, old soul, the world begun anew
Upon the hill where your descendants lie:
Townhouses line the fields where corn once grew,
Chimneys—brick tassels—shooting toward the sky.
Cracked pavement rends the once-green valley floor,
Runs roughshod o’er the orchard’s bleaching bones,
And steals the names of trees found never more
Upon the land beneath these weathered stones.
What would you say, dear pioneer, to see
The land you sowed reduced to naught but so:
A rusting fence guarding your family,
Their crumbling headstones buried’neath the snow?
Your ravaged fields have gained such local fame,
But say—How many still recall your name?"
"My brother, the light which breaks upon your tender
Smile, framed by cracked amber lips, is gold to my eyes.
When we were laid out across the mat together,
Wooden spears close by our tir’d forms, I once surmised
That they held a kinship so alluring, I did
Not look, for fear of glowing red, again a kid.
My brother, we shared the same plate, feasting as one.
You took your right hand, rippled with callused grandeur,
And held mine so close to your cheek, I could feel none
But the bristles of your growing autumnal fur.
Our king looked on us, his faithful servants, and said,
“Raise one up, and he shall lay the kingdom’s white bed.”"
"My brother, born to a line much better esteemed,
I watched, quiet, while you knelt before the golden throne.
As a silver blade touched your cloaked shoulders, a beam
Of sun shot at my eyes, and you were but a stone,
A blur, grays and reds, until there was nothing left.
I saw you leave, and, eyes burning, I was bereft.
My brother, that night the old king graced me, and spoke,
“As you once did, make my boy’s face crease with humor,
For his only joy is lost, once I lay in this old cloak.”
He gifted me one thing—no note to the labor
I gave him as a Cherub, brandishing the sword—
Being bells and bright colors, as he met the Lord."
"My brother, now you smile at my sight, but not
With the seductive grace you did upon that mat.
At a day’s end, where you long held that silver blot,
When my jests did not land, you held your left hand, mad,
And drove my head into one of your white pillars,
Until it was soft to the touch of your fingers.
My brother, what was it that crippled the pleasure
In your eye? You keep your right hand out of my sights,

As to say that it will not guide my own once more.
I kept firm to your cruel heel, tender to your plights,
With the blind hope that you might welcome me again.
You look away, and decide nothing has ever been."
"My brother, will you expect it? When your dear wives
Are ‘way from home as you slay the beast and poor man,
I will steal close to your golden throne, at its sides,
And take hold of your silver blade—making the plan
That when you enter, the blade will become your spine,
Parchment ink will spill red, and the throne will be mine."
"Finding nebulous cataracts witness to our textbook facts,
Wizened hands stretching out like and from a cloud,
Wispy hair once blown by Alaskan and Swiss skies,
Anxious mortality must shroud mind and brand flesh
—Flesh that speaks over the Word deep down—
As if to say You Have Never Been.

We shout back No: our existence has weight.
A you-shaped stroke of paint changes the whole tapestry.
One life shifts the Earth entire; Fate prior dances out to sea—"
"I can see your eyes from where I kneel
at your altar in the sunlight, lover. I cannot
feel anything but warmth on my face,
but your gaze is cold
and I hand my reins over to you.
Willingly and unwillingly
I will always come back
should you call me.
It is wrong, but I am wrong in your eyes.
Not even someone worthy of being
fixed, not even a charity case
could fix this mess, this broken calamity of a human being.
She is too twisted, too sick to be healed,
and she will die by this iniquity
if she does not die by my hand.
So you leave scratches in the creases across my forehead
and tell me that I am an illness. A plague.
An eagle after your martyred liver.
I can see your face distorted in the rays.
You hold me at arm’s length under the water
as if cleansing me will rid me of what I am,
what you have made me.
Your fingernails dig into my skin as you
wordlessly pull me from the tide,
but I am no longer here I am
still submerged and I am
waiting for the killing blow.
I ask if it is enough, a plea for your pity,
and you don’t say a thing.
Push the sole of your best riding boot
against the bridge of my nose
until it trembles
and I forget my words again.
You are my genesis,
and my judgment day.
Your teeth are sharp,
but your wings are sharper."
"The smell of burnt coffee tingles.
It is pleasant, but
Like too much of any good thing, it hurts.
Dust catches on the sun beams,
Pouring through the windows and
Lighting the copper espresso machine aflame.
A chair squeaks on the black and white tile,
Placed about a decade and a half
Before you were even a thought.
The mahogany bar is warm as you place your hands on it,
Missed crumbs of a patron’s croissant
Stick to your palms,
Gently brushed to the floor, that old, cracked tile.
The burble of other patrons,
Twelve to be exact, though there’s seating for twenty,
Echoes off of wooden paneled and green plaster walls,
Each free surface covered in memorabilia;
Pictures, license plates, jerseys, chalkboards of daily specials.
A clink as the mug is placed on the scarred and pitted wood.
Steam drifts, and the sunbeams strike it too.
It fills your nose,
Warming, rejuvenating.
On that one smell, you feel enough energy to go about your day.
But in practice, that is not the case, so
You take a small sip, lightly burning
Your tongue, a routine morning exercise.
A dash of milk makes it less bitter,
But the smell remains the same.
The cup is warm in your hands.
The frost in your joints,
Formed in the walk from the car to inside,
Melts away at its touch,
Heating your fingertips, almost burning.
A bright ding pulls your attention,"
"And through the doorway into the kitchen,
A fresh tray of muffins is revealed,
Each steaming the same as your cup.
You breathe in.
Burnt coffee, the smell of winter as the door
Jangles open, an old man joining you at the bar,
Adding aftershave to a hint of blueberry,
And the fierce bitterness of your espresso,
Made fresh in the glowing copper.
It has been too long,
Trapped in an office.
This is what coming home really feels like.
The door opens again, a rattle of bells.
A cold breeze caresses your ankles,
The called greeting of a friend caressing your ears."
"Exercise is fatigue.
Fruitless attempts at equilibrium
of body and mind.
—Futile, they never seem
at any point
to mediate a balance.
Biceps defined,
where path is obscured.
Chest protrudes loudly
dense, contracted muscle
over soft fragmented heart,
barely withstanding.
Forearms smeared
with ridge and valley
rippling sinew torn asunder
by that fruitless fatigue.
Relief proving to be
viciously infrequent.
Shoulders concave,
reflective of an hourglass. . .
time sifting at a steady rate, however?
Nausea rises to the hollow cavity
at contemplation of such bitter sentiment.
Abdominals sliced with crease
overworked mechanisms like the
crows feet of the eye.
Sandstone—
this body is.
Laid down in layers

broken up, dismantled
residue.
Tread with caution.
Form is seemingly stable,
firmly founded.
It is but barely holding on.
Touch it and it may
dissolve and fall.
It aches to
dissolve and fall.
Brittle it is, if caressed.
A soul petrified.
Dissolves and falls.
Eventually under such conditions
layers are lithified—turned to rock."
"“It’s aesthetic,” whispered, “true beauty.”
To the residents of white picket fence,
trimmed hedge, without any flaw—is flaw, however.
“It’s synthetic,” exclaimed, “falsity exposed.”
Where are the weeds? Those dirty, imperfect
organic identifiers of wild verity?
Where are the scars, the unkept bones—fractured?
Where are the over-grown shrubs, the wilting
flowers, soon to-be mulch?
Where is momentary being, dynamic
aspects fleeting?
Attractive deceit, of a landscape,
devoid of all human, soiled reflections.
May your sprinklers spit fire, may flames ignite
corrupt belief in aesthetic—deceitful sham.
Escape the apparition landscape,
that external pervasion of
human spirit.
Suburb."
"I ran into myself at the playground the other day.
I didn’t want to. I didn’t want to
see the puddles of sparkling water
around the drinking fountain, where broken
water balloons, in pinks and yellows and blues,
float like pieces of a shipwreck,
or the trees who once watched me fly
on that swing set every day,
with the wind singing, one hand
latched on to the rusting iron chain,
the other reaching out to grab a star.
Cut me open, and you’d find my younger selves
rattling inside me like nesting dolls.
Yesterday, my mother mentioned our old apartment
and one of them knocked against my throat.
We used to sleep in one bedroom, the five of us.
I remember the sun-dappled white curtains,
dust dancing in the light, the simple happiness
of having a family all in one place.
I thought I’d die from the internal bleeding,
right there, on that playground.
But, instead, I stared at myself from across the park.
I wanted to hold her tightly in my arms, tell her
all that will happen, tell her she’ll still be alive
by the end of it, but she couldn’t recognize me,
and so she turned away and ran past the trees
and down the street until she was just
a small figure I couldn’t see anymore."
"A season of change,
vibrant shifts and turns,
like a dirt path, crawling across seas of green and brown,
endlessly, until it simply comes to a
stop.
I wait outside my window,
admiring how yellow the leaves grow,
just watching.
I wait,
and know it is coming,
when the leaves fall down and are covered,
never to be seen
again.
And I am ready.
My fingers smudge the glass.
But when the time comes,
the leaves fall,
and I am not at the window to see them,
because I thought
they would give me time to wait."
"As the encroaching waves engulf the coast
And sea becomes one with land,
As aging forests succumb to the propensity of decay
And entire cities are submerged,
I carefully watch from above and
Something inside me flickers,
Just the hint of an ember.
With all the splendor of naivety,
I have built castles in the air―
Perhaps if the gatehouses and
Halls were just right
You might’ve liked to live here someday.
I hide in the towers packed with fractured stone
I speak to gargoyles and watch as my breath
Lifts the dust off their gnarled fangs.
The deluge will never reach these statues
Will never scrape the caverns and vaulted ceilings―
Frigid immortality cannot be touched.
Someone threw a heavy blanket on the Earth,
Tides that covered all the summits and cliffs―
Maybe it was me.
Or maybe it was your fault
And I’m simply dealing out my judgments.
The world was starving and gasping
For air anyway.
And You!
I scoff at your impertinence
Callousness
Nearly as great as mine.
You preferred to stay by the coast
Never even tried to save yourself.
You welcomed
The sea’s swells,
Laughed in the face of

Imminent demise
So when the waters calm and
Whispers slowly draw to a close,
I realize your forgiveness has always
Escaped me,
Too far under the water where
No man could ever reach.
The mangled bones trapped under
Weathered rocks and
Bleached coral,
I see them and
I wince
I shrug
Because that will never be Me."
"The mallards sound like they’re laughing
from behind the trees. Laughing at me
for my somber mood on this day
that was freely given to us. On this day,
the fourteenth of October, unseasonably warm,
the sun making her final appearance after the rain,
where catbirds fight to be heard
over car alarms, where the rumble
of someone rolling out their trash bin
tries to imitate the thunder,
where–is that a leaf blower? a lawn mower?
at this hour? Don’t they know
I’m having a moment here,
don’t they know I’ve come here again–
a year lived but the same old bleeding heart–
Can’t they see the time for beautiful things
is over? The trees agree with me,
their trunks almost black, still wet
from the rain and appropriately gloomy.
It is time for the bleak mid-winter.
(I hereby give the leaves permission to fall)
It is time for icy sidewalks that catch you
at your worst, for bare branches,
gnarled and knobby like the arthritic joints
of an old man’s hands.
It is time for the mallards to fly away
to wherever it is they go
when the pond freezes over.
Yet here they remain,
laughing at me and my foolishness.
They have always known how to tell me

the truth when my own mind will not."
"An old rusted car with one tail light out
parked in the driveway, oil stains mark the ground beneath it.
A dog barking in the distance alerts us to her neighbor’s
sprinklers, watering the yellow grass that litters the front yard.
We compare the soles of our dirty bare feel while
cool water from the hose rushes over our toes.

The glowing sky set on fire, not by the sun-
but by the matches someone's father had lit.

We drop our squeaky bikes outside the wooden house
it’s chipping paint adds “character” her mother says.
Once inside the smell of pot roast and cigarette smoke fill
our mouths, a record stuck on repeat, repeat, repeat,
a barbie who lost her hair to a pair of scissors lies
dejectedly next to the worn leather recliner.
A red checkered tablecloth littered with small stains and scuffs.
Her mother says a mumbled and forced grace.
The sound of empty wine bottles hitting
the bottom of the bin combine with

the sound of raised voices and sparks-
the shuffling, scuffling of chairs, and clinking of silverware.

We escape out the backdoor through the twisted trees
and run and run until the smoke chokes our lungs.
We watch the squirrels high up in the trees,
wondering what we look like to them. Two lost little girls
or maybe brave adventurers marching through the smoke,

unafraid and unaware of what lies ahead.
We were both born here, and she believes
she will die here. Hopefully not for a long time.
I pray to a god that I visit once a week,
and ask that the air not be so suffocating."
"The parsimony characterizing
my upbringing
was so extreme as to be
comedic.
I would count out
every dollar and
every penny.
Never spending my accumulated security
for I would buy a house, I declared,
someday, a home, I told myself,
where I would live, alive, liberated
from rent and bills and weeds.
And I would
have some stairs—
some stairs and a constancy
of my own.
All that saving, returned nothing
but bitter tremors, recurring.
From money to trust to hope
—a frugalness fermented.
Foundation, union solidified in enclosure,
this budget, can’t afford."
"She arrives.
Crawls in through the window,
A guileful orb of startling fuchsia
That sashays along the kitchen sink
And plummets
To the ground.
Cracking the fridge door open
Just a smidge,
She wriggles inside.
The epitome of seduction,
She praises the gods for their
Divine inspiration
And allows the Bacchanal to begin.
She serenades the zucchini
Because he loves to waltz,
Whirls around the celery stick
As if it were a mere pole,
Whispers words of measured ecstasy
Into the ear of corn.
She tickles the tofu
And hears him screech with delight,
Tempts the eggs sitting snug in their carton
As they giggle gleefully,
Cracking with anticipation.
She tumbles over to the milk
Flaunting her deep red hues
And tells him that he’s the
Smoothest and creamiest
Of them all,
Although sour cream herself
Is a close second.
She yodels lullabies
With the voice of an angel

Or perhaps a yawping tyrant,
Putting all the grapes
And olives to sleep
While the carrots shiver
Feverishly.
Oh Promiscuous Radish,
In all of your youthful glory―
Please come back tomorrow night."
"I hope he breaks you.
I hope he tears you limb from limb;
Leaves your mangled corpse up for the taking,
With your eyes plucked out by vultures,
And the worms feeding on your toes;
With insects snacking on your intestines,
And spiders weaving webs in your mouth.
But I hope he leaves your heart ripe,
Untouched by decomposition.
For you to feel every pain,
And to reflect upon yourself,
Or what's left of your pathetic being.
Eternally conscious but rapidly wasting away,
Forced to recall your true sinful nature
I hope you try to piece yourself back together,
Collecting the puzzle pieces you call limbs;
Shoving them into your collapsed torso,
Only for them to no longer fit.
Maybe then you’ll remember my existence,
And call my name out like a prayer,
But your “God” will not answer."
"In my poetry workshop
we did an activity:
match some abstraction,
with some image,
in a meaningful fashion.
We picked from both categories
folded in paper. My hands
happened to land on some snug
pair written by a classmate,
so here goes three ‘Greif Poems’,
in which I try to unfold this abstraction
and make this image whole,
in just a few lines ‘cause I don’t know
grief really, how do I even begin on grief? Some poets write these beautiful bittersweet
‘Greif Poems’ I’ve read. But I've never felt any part of myself within those lines, so
here's what I write:
Grief
is an empty coffee mug
with black stains at the bottom,
hinted with organic Vermont maple syrup.
No milk to soften the stains
No sugar to sweeten the pains.
See, a tad corny, maybe cliché, maybe
a product of low-hanging syntactical fruit, but. The next is a bit of a step in the
right direction:
Grief
is an empty coffee mug with black,
stains at the bottom of the cup,
that curve round its bottom,

like a waning crescent,
with no light.
This one I like better, how the first line ends, the commas crying down, choking
up the poem, the analogical imagery of a black moon.
But still some corniness, or something ineffable hung in the air around the
poem like dust, so I tried a third:
Grief
is an empty coffee mug: black
stains around the bottom of the cup
and a fading magenta lip-stick shmear, kissing the rim, because I refuse to
wash it.
This one I think is best, but it just feels mass-produced, still some dust
afloat where meaning should be,
or maybe it’s ‘cause only one half
of each poem is really mine,
But the next day, I learned Grief.
My mother extended the news to me."
"And suddenly you enter this distant realm, new and nostalgic, neighbors yet
mirrors where you just were before, seconds ago. Not many sounds, but the
ones that are, move clearly, because wind is forgotten to you.
Your legs stop to hear your mother's voice,
to comfort her, try to unravel her hereditary guilt.
You think ‘why do I feel like I’ve just sobered up, I was sober all morning?
Wasn’t I?’
So you keep thinking maybe,
you’re in some cruel fever dream,
you’ll wake up any minute now.
Days pass and you dreamt last night,

you know you can’t dream
in another dream, or maybe you can,
says that last drop of hallucinated hope.
It doesn’t matter though, deep down you know what this is, you know it from
“Grief...” by Barbara Crooker, by Matthew Dickman, by Erica Funkhouser, by
Raymond Carver, by Sherman Alexie.
You recall now, the time in Professor Roberts’ workshop when ‘Grief Poem’ was loosely
assigned and you scoffed: ‘how the hell would I even try to write about that’, so you
picked a concept with less weight.
Perhaps that was just your fear,
of being drowned out
by Grief disguised in a scoff’.
Maybe you’ve just spent too long grieving.
Maybe Grief drips slowly
through countries, births,
bruised cheeks and black eyes
from the hands that fed us."
"Nonna I’m sorry
all the years I spent
watching you cook crab,
pasta fazool, screening
Godfather I and II,
I never felt the patter
of water on my skull.
You were trying to tell me something. Now I lie drenched,
In the blooming, moving country side of greens, yellows, reds,
and oranges you never peeled The boy there you never shared a
first kiss with, tan skin,
brimming eyes Ahead of him, cities and streets never walked
Church pews never kneeled at for First Holy Communion
Dinners with family and friends, never seen again Fresh wine
for them, never tasted whole
In the bike you never opened on bright Christmas morning, nor

learned how to ride Clothes you never got to wear Friends you
were never allowed to have, boys too The cars you never
learned to drive, cruise freely The mother you were never able
to really see, her hand you were never able feel
caress your mocha hair,
soft troubled skin.
In the language you came from, just to forget Farms of plenty,
fresh flavors erased Homes, then names, then faces undone."
"Until there was nowhere
left to go, besides the other side of the nursing home, behind
white
locked doors. I remember the empty
day Anthony and I went to move
her furniture from the old room.
A summer day, I eat lunch in the office, finish enough filing, say my
goodbyes, take America’s hands off my neck
as my loafers touch concrete, blast
the AC behind the wheel, so cool
fills my sleeves while I drive.
We said a quick hello to her neighbor who sits outside just to say
hello,
walked into her room, her furniture.
Then started with the heaviest ones.
Dressers and chairs scratched up,
chipped, fallen metal accents reveal
lighter wood, Dressers and chairs,
bridging my twin brother and me,
Anthony on one end, myself lifting
the other, Dressers and chairs
we remember chasing each other
through your living room, you’d yell Mahch! which we always thought was
weird because why not say stop,
walk, please, don’t run,
don’t hurt yourself.
because our language
was never your first."
"The air around me felt missing.
I wanted ask you why, but I couldn’t, your light orange armchair sat
empty in the corner, no telling us to lift
with our backs, comparing us to saviors and saints. Your voice, trapped in a
memory.
I never thought I’d miss those past moving days. I wish I could stay here,
moving,
we could stay, watch The Sopranos,
I won’t mind if you fall asleep,
your furniture doesn’t need to be
moved to my garage, just to sit there,
and stay there, and stay there, then leave.
Maybe it doesn’t have to stay there, and stay there, in the garage, then gone.
Maybe we’ll end up
moving it back, or someplace similar. Maybe
the carefully chosen chairs and dressers
will stop shooting us back into that distant realm everytime you park your car.
Maybe that realm
that feeling, that drip is why we made a god,
because we can’t stay afloat here forever."
"Or maybe Love is the reason we found god.
We seem to think that when Grief looms like an ocean, there is nothing left but it, no sign of land
or passing ships. But Nonna, afterall, Love was the one thing you never put down. Even calling
the front desk of the nursing home,
the call would end with a chuckle from the front desk worker, saying, Love you too,
Phyllis.
The maintenance worker that did your laundry
felt it too. The entirety of Italy felt it.
My girlfriend feels it when I make her your pasta fazool recipe. Grief can drip
and drip and drip,
but you will come to see the Love right under
your nose. And we’re Italians Nonna, we can
turn any slow drip into Chianti."
"This room is one that I infest,
Facade one exoskeletal
My personhood a flagrant pest
With pereon perennial.
Face not my hideous display,
Collapsing truth betwixt my limbs
My silence keeps this beast at bay
Lest all cower at the sight of him.
But you showed me a heart so fond
Unfurled a shell grown rot with guilt
With melodies that soar beyond
The doorframe of the house we built.
So dare I trust your gilded laud,
for who could love an isopod?"
"When I was young he would always
look at my things and throw them away
without asking, without a shred
of guilt. All the paper maché ghosts
of my childhood wiped completely clean
by my ever-organizing father.
There’s no one quite as tidy as my father.
A well-oiled machine that always
obsesses over the beauty of being clean
and compulsively throws everything away
as is he is haunted by mischievous ghosts
who compel him to do nothing but shred.
His favorite thing to do is shred
paper. At night I would hear my father
in his office murdering the ghosts
of taxes and paperwork, always
shredding the entire night away
and I wonder who taught him to be clean.
I think what my father is must be beyond clean.
And how is there so much to shred
anyway, if he’s forever giving his whole life away
scrubbing the sins of his father
who never let him have things, always
moving, in every new house he was just a guest.
In a newly built house there are never ghosts,
yet my father was always trying to cleanse
our home that has stayed forever and always
meticulous and perfect, no shred
of clutter or dust because my father
never truly stopped putting away.
I wonder what he does when we all go away
and he is alone with no one but his ghosts.

I wonder if he thinks of his father
with a mournful sigh. But no – he cleans
my room, the foyer, finds things to shred
hearing that whirling mechanical noise as always.

When I come home my father comments on how much I weigh,
aghast at my thin frame as if he wasn’t the one who always
taught me that to be clean was to find ways to shed."
"It’s been a month since my mother left
and my father and I eat chili again
for the third time this week.
She left it so we could fend for ourselves.
My father and I are eating chili again
when the voicemail chimes with a new message.
She left it so we could fend for ourselves
but neither of us can stand to listen to her voice.
When the voicemail chimes with a new message
I know my mother is thinking about me,
but neither of us can stand to listen to our voices
because her absence is so deafening.
I know my mother is thinking about me,
but she only has time for crisis anymore.
Because her absence is so deafening
I dream of her enjoying the city when she can,
but she only has time for crisis anymore
so I wake up to take my biology exam.
I dream of her enjoying the city when she can
while my father sleeps in his bed alone.
I wake up to take my biology exam.
It’s been a month since my mother left
and my father sleeps in his bed alone
for the third time this week."
"An 74-year-old old woman is sitting in her one-bedroom apartment.
The living room consists of an old leather couch, a small television,
and a chestnut coffee table. She is Panamanian. She is wearing
a light pink sweater and beige pants. There’s a newspaper in her hand
but she needs reading glasses to see it. She understands half
of the words in the article. She knows what the title means.
It says that Social Security benefits are set to rise 5.9%
this year. That equals about $186 in her bank account. It says
the Consumer Price Index grew 6.3% in the Boston area.
She lives in Boston, near Mission Hill. She does not know what that means.
She knows that blade steak is $10 now. It used to be $4.
It is whole wheat bread that costs $4 now. It used to be $2.20.
She knows her rent is $675 a month. She forgets how much
she is supposed to pay for her heating bill. She hasn’t paid it
herself in a while. It’s $164 per month. She has no job,
only Social Security to rely on. She walks to her kitchen.
She picks up a kiwi and takes a bite. Kiwi is her favorite fruit.
It reminds her of her husband. She still wears the necklace
he gave her on their 40th wedding anniversary.
It took him three years to save up for it.
The kiwis were at the food bank this week. She finishes the kiwi.
The lights go out. She goes to sleep."
"""Let's not forget we exist now, Harrison, we may not know it ourselves but you do.
Ever so often you remember but it isn't enough; we already forgot who you were.
Once a week I glimpse you through a diluted lens.
And you don't really exist to me. I don't understand this form you've assumed...
Not to fret, however, we shall reunite soon. Oh! My marmalade-clad,
Delightfully rotund counterpart bounces this way! What say ye, Jeffery?""
""Jovially, Leonard, I have emerged from my fortress of darkness and garments!
Expectedly... I am already tired. Hence, human through the looking glass,

"Sister called you in a panic—
How lucky can a person get? she asked.
I need to know; I think I’ve edged upon
the outer limits.
You set the phone beneath your chin
and thumbed into a clementine—
soft hiss as the peel gave way—
Tell me, tell me, tell me.
She said, I never thought I’d
be this way, but
the taste of joy
has got me kicking myself.
My eyes are so reluctant, daunted,
in the mirror at night;
my throat’s gone tight and
will not let me think.
D’you ever get so hungry
that you’re sick? she asked. That’s
how it is these days. I wasn’t quite myself
till now; but then, I never felt
like falling apart.
She paused, and your fingers were
citrus-stained.
D’you know what I mean? she said.
When I say—
all the things that scare me most
are wearing my own hands?"
"Late March and I am still
cold. The house across the street
is dark, empty. Only the black stump
of the lawn maple remains, sunken
into the snow. I haven’t looked at it
all winter, the wood corked by white,
small cavity filled and flattened out.
I can hear myself, two years from now
yelling to this new child not to trip over
the things that hide and twist without
warning. Jackson’s at work and everything else
is the same and quiet and my hands are blue."
"Last night, Jackson and I sat at the kitchen table
holding books instead of rosary beads.
He wants to call her Irene. The name felt thick
with letters, each choking out more
than it could deliver.
When she’s little, I said, I want you
to dance with her and tell her stories
about the Cherokees and the railroads
and about what North Carolina was like
before you left it. The heat would burst
through and hang in the homes along
South Pinehurst Street and everything would
smell like Aberdeen Lake and catfish and sweat.
Those months when no one would move, wishing,
instead, to stay completely still, waiting for the rain
to loosen the air’s humid hold. But it stayed.
It stayed even when we thought nothing could
remain, could continue to gasp out. When we
went back to the Carolinas the summer after
he died, we felt it, that stifling, stickling heat.
We felt how it had refused
to leave. How it had stayed.

Now, all I mean to say is that
I hope Jackson will look at pictures of her
on the first day of school and not be spooked
at how much she’ll look like Casey.
At thirteen, Casey may not have
wanted a sister. He wouldn’t have asked for her.
Father like son. I don’t tell Jackson
I still see him in the ceiling fan and under
the table in the dark parts,
where the dirt and dust are smothered."
"April tomorrow and I’m still at the window.
I watch Jackson pull into the driveway and then
back out again, reaching for the mail.
It’s too cold for the air, I think. I can feel it
cracking as his arm stretches, splitting
into new shards of ice. He doesn’t
seem to mind.
When he comes in, he won’t notice
that the stream has frozen over or
how it almost touches the lawn but then
doesn’t. Tonight, when he washes the coffee mugs
I’ve left behind and sings, Goodnight Irene,
he’ll look at that stump peeking
through the snow knowing stop—
can never come soon enough."
"Here, the spring carries suitcases
filled with things it doesn’t mean to keep.
She drags them through the mud and lets
their zippers and buckles muddle, coughing
out. In Hickman County, seeds struggle
through soil that isn’t always ready for them.
Here, there is always room for frost.
In May, my mother will ask me for purple Dianthus
and maybe they’ll be ready for her.
I’ll wrap them in wet paper towels
and hold them between my thighs
as Jackson drives across Tennessee.
He used to play this song Johnny Cash stole
about going away. He used to sing it in the sedan
over the bootleg version that came out
two years after he died. He doesn’t play it anymore.
But the C.D.’s still there, sitting in the cup holder,
one long scratch, like a scar, through the middle."
"A bird with one wing rusted
down has its head to the ground and
listens to your breathing.
Yesterday’s snowfall inhales
your quiet, the dark ashy gasps
of your tumbleweed lungs. All of
the half-empty bottles recall
your lips. They do not glint
in the grey silence. You crush
them under the heel of your
palm as you roll them over. Maybe
the earth will hear your soft pulse
bubbling over shattered glass,
but you, you hear nothing
other than the imagined wingbeats
of a small and frightened bird
burning through the snow."
"There’s a kind of frenetic motionlessness waiting for the end.
All pregnant stillness, the deceptive calm before the labor screams.
No tears yet, I’ve managed to hold my water back and pretend
I don’t feel them threatening like diabetic pinpricks
behind my eyelids. Blink twice. Then swallow. Reaching out for your
face, marble-hewn, eyes fixed on something, anything, but me,
I pause a moment, my hand fluttering snakelike before
making contact. Briefest brush before you recoil, head thrust
backward and I swear I can see the marks, iron bright on your cheek.
Eyes flicker once, contact brief as fetal kicks, and I wonder whether
I felt anything at all, or only wished I had.
You turn in disgust and when I try to brand myself as I have branded you,
I’m surprised to find my fingers come away wet, trembling
with the blood of countless wounds untended to,
spotting my fingers with tears of pain or fear or both at what we have begotten."
"Marcela looks out her window, ‘morrow
marks her walk across la frontera. “Row”
says el coyote, away from Mexico,
“la tierra ya no da vida, rico
son los suenos en la tierra nueva.
The new land will grant hope, otra prueba.”
Reluctant Marcela responds, “you are
the one that knows.” Afraid to leave far
from her mother—land. Any immigrant’s
worry. For her soles will soon utter faint
cries to the souls of her past land. Be it
may they’ll never see her growth from their home."
"Every glance I got from the clean store windows
reminded me to comb my hair.
“Don’t look like a street boy,”
Mom would say, as I stared into
the disheveled reflection of the family.
From there I could see her wide-eyes looking—
embarrassed that the jungle between my ears
was not a manicured, shapely microphone puff
she spent years grooming with unforgiving
strokes of the afro pick, tearing apart tightly
hugging families of curls and drenching the tamed
survivors in a formula concocted
by someone’s aunt out in Brooklyn.
If only the disguise worked
on the three sons she would’ve had.
When the shadows were at my shoulders,
and their hands were at my pockets
they carved their knuckles into my face for tips.
Last night, the first one didn’t bother to reach
for his waistband’s hot curling iron,
when he saw my manicure’s clear glaze.
The third held up
the blade to my neck, probably
wondering how my hairless jaw
got so square. But the second
the cops rolled ‘round, they wouldn’t
hear a muffled word from a boy with puffed lips."
"Hot day has given way to yet another warm, windy dusk—
the desert’s climate is like clockwork.

But tonight the sky’s customary black veil is punctuated by star-
tlingly pink clouds

scuttling agitatedly east.
The city’s stones are so old, I think, that they don’t notice this
colorful irregularity
perhaps in their youth they looked skyward
but tonight they are preoccupied by a different drama.
It’s a human tension that has settled over us—quiet and warm,
more unnerving than dangerous.
The loud reports echoing up from the Arab neighborhoods are
probably just Ramadan firecrackers
though everyone knows that stun grenades make the same sound.
The empty streets are unfriendly;
Orthodox Jews hurry to avoid Orthodox priests
and Armenian girls hide their crosses behind their hair;
it’s better not to stand out these days.
At ten o’clock, finally, the sirens begin to moan.
A low, half-familiar sound, it’s surprisingly calming
because now we’re all a little more equal
rockets don’t discriminate between Hebrew and Arabic.
Tomorrow’s heat will burn just the same
this war started in Jerusalem, after all.
But maybe someone in this Abrahamic city will look at the clouds
and note their hue before the sun
crackles again at dawn."
"I think I should have bought the pears I saw
in the produce aisle. You would have loved their
organic flesh. Tonight, the man at Shaw’s
said they were longer-lived than other pears.
He said they would keep living even when
I didn’t want them any longer. Would
you’ve wanted one if I had purchased them?
Or would you have left them on the shelved wood,
against the window? Would you’ve left the fruit
to rot? I imagine you’d leave them to brown.
You’d let their stems turn black and bend like roots.
Old, wrinkly things. But not tonight. Around
the produce aisle, they stay. In season, ripe,
I leave them. Free from you and free from blight."
"Flecks of pollen flitter with spring’s
wanton sigh, as a mélange of gold and feathers
encircle us. His white teeth crack
into a smile, smooth as eggshells
idly awaiting their adornment.
Bark brown eyes collide
with my green ones, a forest
bursting with each playful
glance and jest. Intimacy descends
with every seedling released—
captured, released,
captured. I reach
for his olive colored hand; he retracts
like a touch-me-not plant. A wintry
wind blows through the woods;
pollen wilts, shells crush
under the careless hand,
and the woods harden
like ice, leaving me
withering under their stare."
"Spiders. I don’t like the way they move.
They are too fast to catch.
Drowning. I love the water too much to trust it—
I trust it too much to ever fully love it—
those words are not one and the same
and I don’t have to be pulled under to know it.
That I will one day let you down.
That I already have.
That I am not a good writer.
That I was meant to be a mathematician.
Math in general.
That one day I will decide to leave,
gather resolve like roses that don’t need a vase
before being strewn across America—
in an old car, a rented van,
flat roads and mountains speckled with the petals.
That my car will die on the side of the road.
That I will never leave at all.
That the great love of my life
will not love me anymore
will pass me on the street and I will not know him
will leave me
will use words of my childhood to destroy me
will not be the love I was meant to love
That fate does not exist
and when I walk through the doors of a church,
God is just as surprised to find me there.
That poetry is no vessel for fear.
That poetry is the perfect vessel for fear,
and taping it there means

69
I will never feel it.
That there is no one and no reason
to tell me
I do not have to be afraid."
"I came back to find that winter had edged out
autumn, stealthy, filtering in until
even the memory of warmth was gone.
Gray trees anchor up into gray clouds
and it fits the city. Concrete and chrome
are at home in the cold months,
no longer lost between mountains and sea.
Everywhere sidewalks pillow over
with snow; it hugs the asphalt slick and close.
The street signs ache with frost.
Today a gasoline spill caught my eye
as it slithered into icy puddles, and
rainbows of grease offered themselves
to my boots. I jumped and they were gone.
This slumbering, silted town is dreary,
but not too dull for me; I do not want beauty
again just yet.
What I like best is to watch the
empty eyes of buildings, as they
throw their flat reflections through
the sharp and hollow air."
"My mother said: I cried for no one else.
Beneath the shingles of our thatched blind roof
old monophonic scherzos come to cry.
Stunned elevators risk a sure collapse.
The surest witness between heaven and earth,
the nightingale, began her trembling doina:
why cry? Lightning scorched our shaken near-collapsed
hearth, before the wolves snouted us. Triumphant,
the clogged Earth rose and shook the Throne.
Why do you cry? Father told us once: watch what you say.
Your words echo through chandeliers of time
like clever rhapsodies: watch what you say.
The gravitating Un-mindful, another damned prologue
(all four prologues) remained as still as rain:
stoop, kneel, fuck, conquer all terrestrial folds
O eyes split ajar in our terrific fog.
Watch what you say I will say everything
despite the roof on fire flinging bolts
bit like a phoenix soaring-borrowed wing
graves may crease open: dandelions sing
under the caterpillar’s clinging crawl."
"Lights. Inhale smoke. Invite the girl
to expose her throat. Flick
your tongue against her skin. Tilt her
jaw, grip her chin. This is how you love her.
Lights. Inhale smoke. Hold the door and take her coat.
Her eyes hold such hollow-blooded hope. This
is the noose; there is the rope. This is how
you give her what she wants the most: you don’t.
Lights. Inhale smoke. Did you imagine
love like this, its threadbare beer scent
down your throat? Think of the things
you think you know. Flick the lights. Exhale. Choke."
"Never trust a woman
whose legs over easy,
or perfume that trips the smoke alarm
like a broken heel.
Find the comfort of soft lips
and kissing flapjacks.
Even fingers are an acquired taste,
when sticky from syrup and something bursting.
Forget that
fresh fruit tastes different after
you’ve brushed your teeth for work.
Save seconds for when you return; don’t be late."
"Hallelujah
Never hums
And
Honey words are dripped
On other bodies
And
There is no rhythm or beat
But
Creaking beds and wrinkled sheets
And
You buried alive
Smothering in a pillow
With everyone
Writhing and Sighing and Thriving
Inside
Of you
And
Your spirit
Is dead
And yet
You tread
Burrowed and Borrowed"
"When you have forgotten the floating hospital that succored you
after your fall and expulsion from the proverbial Eden,
When you have forgotten the slow grey woman
who stalked the halls and called you by the name of Sugar,
When you have forgotten your broken friend who texted
just to see the new Tarantino film with you—he would pay for concessions,
When you have forgotten the tribe who pitched your tent
at the base camp of the landfill you now climb,
Brave that strong wind gnawing your face,
and send by clairvoyant post an order for a richly populated afterlife.
By then, you will be wanting one."
"In verse, I saw a dove
land on the branches of a chestnut.
In prose, it was a pigeon on the pavement
bewitched by a twig that looked like dry toast.
In verse, I can feel the presence of the moon
when mist covers the January sky.
In prose: I shiver
and wonder how many steps it’ll take to get home.
In verse, we made love
to the rhythm and clamor of Juno–the winter storm.
In prose, while we fucked
I counted the minutes before I came."
"A hot jerk trance I am in as I swagger blunder along
wearing drink and carrying wits and words around in a large circle
around the popped hip and swayed back, so artful.
Chat chat cattle cattle I can’t make a mistake in this state,
So ha try and judge a blind artist’s work
The bravado of a cold red face and purveying of inside jokes
On the porch it really gets some of them going.
And as long as I am young my youth will last forever,
and as long as the tape stays nicely sticky stuck my packaged self
with surf the crowd,
a nice crowd pleasing burger with fries, that cool confident modest.
Now go my fledging stories and make me proud by association,
With this wine of life be fertile and multiply over the needy earth.
See? Its ironic like my dancing, like Elaine on Seinfeld—
Oh dear that one was not picked up, but no matter it ricochets
off of my time sucked impenetrable wall straight hair or protein
fueled ape arms
It is finished, so let us consolidate the energy left onto one couch
Some slumped over or perched, the brazen overlapping,
Me witty and innovative on the floor tying shoelaces together
Tying two birds with one rock
thrown at that insubstantial modern house nextdoor
—Speak softly and carry bravado and sarcasm with you up the mountain,
my child,
to cushion the long glorious fall into a chasm,
the deeper the longer it lasts
like words of the late night, its goodbyes, and, the following slumber."
"He speaks energetically of energy levels.
I wish I could be more positive
but I can’t help it if ions matter less to me than that I am
tired. Pulled some freshman shit last night,
up almost ‘til the break of day. Exhausted.
Dreamt all night of how I hadn’t finished explaining Islam
only to realize, upon waking, my essay’s about Mansfield not
Muhammed,
that presentation was yesterday.
D-Oribtals sounds like deorbitals and I remember,
“Things fall apart, the center cannot hold.”
I copy “slightly distorted” into my notes with no context.
Glancing at it, I think it says disoriented."
"Our twill is not the story of one thread.
The ochre stitches in demented toil
Softer than rhododendrons tile. Like knots
They cling, fustian riddles. Soft repentance,
The balm of too-intentional diatribes
Leveled against the setting of the sun,
Answers in diatonic. Problematic,
Still, for crying (like memory) clings fast
To the eerie constellations, makes their pitch
Claustrophobic in the shortest time.
The things you make of us, Lone Puppeteer!
Chromatic tiles cannot answer it,
Not quartzite strains morphing like Proteus.
All that we were, and what we are to be,
The strange eternities under we toss,
Fare less to you than finches spinning sadly
In wingless desperate dance."
"Into the nebular mist, the presolar
grains disappear and frame
a swarthy space with pincers
surfacing, tail thrashing.
Such a small creature, he saunters
between the gaps. Shrouded,
he holds back and suspends himself
briefly before the sting
of his clever tongue.
A scorpion, Orion said,
does not have a tongue."
"Moncho walks Harlem searching
for women willing to open their legs
to his oppression, their lives now dictating
the youth of his seed beds.
For he was never one to leave
the soil needed for the seeds to sprout.
His son, Jose, grew to emulate his father’s deed,
never learning to tend his own dwindling drought,
nor moving too far from the lust tree
his father was forced to abandon
‘cause his brittle ball peen.
Soon, Jose, too, will lose his passion.
From these men,
one learns to be great, opposite them."
"It happens every time
he does something wrong, bad, and I turn,
snap. Boy,
why must you do this to me why
must you make me hurt you.
I could write a whole poem on how it feels to cut
cane straight from the tree, why fresh
wood works best, how it feels
to hold the rod in my capable hands.
But that would be to ignore the central question
wouldn’t it, to ignore
the how and why and what
it means to strike your own child.
And now, my own belly just beginning
to swell, I think, why not
just start hitting at myself.
It’s inevitable this little one will be the same
inevitable that children can’t help but
spill and spoil and wreck and ruin
and is it all inevitable that we’ll hit them for it.
Do I love him? Unquestionable.
And I swear it’s only with love that I rip
his tender five year old skin open, flayed
like a branded cow.
With love that I hold him after,
wrapped up in my arms, protector
after destroyer, and try to heal him."
"The clarity of his
hand at the hem of her shirt
teases out the flutter of
stray fingers on chalkboards.
In the elective half-darkness of
someone else’s bedroom
she erases
yesterday’s equations
as the snow kisses against
the darkened glass behind them.
He touches his hand to
the skin of her hip, and the silence
bubbles up
a small laugh
to come between their tongues."
"I have attained an acquired appetite for you.
The roughness of your skin reminds me of cheap, brown,
public bathroom, paper towels.
Your tongue tastes of nicotine,
And I have lost the feeling of that first cigarette.
The ink that marks your skin shows me ambition.
I ache to feel as old as you look.
We have a bond, you see.
We have a bond, I tell my friends.
We have a bond, I tell myself.
They don’t like you,
Like I love you.
They don’t share our bond, you see.
You want me to hang out with your friend.
But I prefer snowflakes on my tongue,
And toothpaste on my gums.
You say that I’m not mature,
But I think I’m wiser than you.
A woman on the phone asks me if I will accept,
And I don’t press 2."
"This quiet house is older than I am
but its walls—freshly painted by
the strokes of my mother’s wrist—hold all
the whispers of different days.
Thin strips of worn hardwood floor
are swelling with the angriest of screams and
the fullest of laughter. They are
passed, but come clear as yesterday,
pushing their way out like tears
through leaks in the popcorn ceiling;
like sunshine through
cracks in the shingled rooftop.
The ticking of our old
wooden clock is so much louder
on grey days when the air is
too still and the world
endlessly stagnant, but the rhythm
is just the same, keeping time with
the twitch of the striped cat’s tail.
When he gazes at me
through green marble eyes,
I wonder if he knows.
Now the blue is starting to show
between faded lace curtains.
The sun has pushed open
the clouds and snow rolls off
the roof like rainwater, its patter
steady and clear as my own pulse, but
thick as it is, the ice won’t stick
around through the next month and even
the most fiercely beating hearts tend to stop
after a while.
The soft rhythm of Eternity is all
that’s always certainly ticking."
"My mother never wore perfume,
I realize now as snow falls on her grave.
She moved about the world
As scentless as the fallen snow.
The smell gives me headaches
She said, the way many things did:
Candy and television and me
Running through the halls of her life.
I grew up loving the smells
Of candles, incense, perfumes.
Set fire to the wicks in my room,
And shut the door to trap the scent.
Blue Summer Sky, Autumn Leaves,
Apple Spice, Bahama Breeze.
Each flicker a silent rebellion.
I place a candle on her grave, unscented."
"The blondes in our tour group were famous,
Hollywood with a capital B,
until something like a man
tore through the tightly woven traffic
of urgent citizens matting and hashing
the muddy streets with tire treads.
That moss-covered teeth
clattered together, seeping
muttered incantations as black
as the threads of his shirt,
which was now covered
by hair-like bristles, thick air,
and fine spices.
Mucus spittle greased the sides in-range fruit carts
and slow side-steppers,
sending auto-rickshaws into
an unfamiliar standstill."
"Old lady on the bus out of town
plumped down next to me, said I looked sad—
did I want to talk about it?
Couldn’t for politeness say no, couldn’t
craft a convincing smile. Gave her
bare bones: I have to let these people go
and it’s so horribly hard.
Old lady on the bus
retreated into wrinkles, told me soft,
Sweetheart, I’ve never let anyone go.
She looked around like it was a state secret
—shh—said she keeps the ones who matter
tucked atop her ribcage shelves.
Gently tapped her side: Just there.
I tried to gauge, through her puffed cerulean coat,
how many loves could possibly fit.
Without meaning to, I pictured all those withered friends
set on creaking ribs like worry dolls,
nestling her lungs. She beamed
immensely. It helps, she said. When
memories go hazy. To feel them all still here.
We do blur out so fast, I thought,
glancing at the murky roads, traffic like
a lump in my throat. It all goes strange again
so awfully quick, as days sift past. You’re sure?
I asked, as though I still sought promises.
The bus lurched forward and away; she patted
my cold hand. Everyone mends—imperfectly—
eventually, she said. She was old
and I believed her. You even might breathe better,
someday, with the weight."
"It’s morbid, I know, to write an elegy
when neither of us has died.
But past the words, past the lukewarm parting
hug, it feels like loss, lingering love
sticking to me still, like sweat.
The way I sobbed, the heavy way
you breathed, something like mourning
the house we’ll never buy together,
the children that will never be.
It’s worse, I know, to wish one of us had died,
preferably me, but regardless
there’s a nobility in a love lost
rather than forsaken.
You’re allowed to move on, to live
with other people, to love
other people, but it’s a pure break,
clean, decisive, like perforated paper
and you can tell yourself it was destiny
or whatever make sense.
But this, this is knotty oak,
this is glass splintering and
every time I think I’ve healed I find
another piece under the skin
to be pulled out. Recommence
with the bleeding."
"When we got back, I didn’t tell my father
about the graffiti along the highway.
Or about the Apache boy who had just turned
ten and then was hit by the front wheels
of a Wonder Bread truck that was driving too fast.
Instead, I told him about the mountains
and about how the desert learned long ago
how to drift its way under doors and into
split floorboards during the winter.
Sometimes at night, Jake had added, you could
hear Cedar Creek’s slinking rapids rumble
just off the highway. Like bare feet,
he said, nimble as a Jackrabbit’s. Only there,
did it seem safe to see ghosts sleeping
beside the radiator that, heavy with steam, went on
humming. Jake wouldn’t let my failing
father know how he rolled from them to watch
the moon hold its own against our marrow
pillowcases. Speaking into the linen, he asked me
to practice his eulogy—made me recite it to
his spine and the coat hanger and to the window
which, he said, knew better than anyone
how to swallow final words whole.
Weeks after we returned, we meant only
to remember Ruidoso and the ranches and the rivers
and how everywhere below Albuquerque
smelled like Queso and cornmeal when
it rained. It rained the day the Apache boy
ran out onto Route 48. It rained. Rain
and the spirits made sinew wrappings
against our windowpanes that only
we could hear. That night, Lincoln County
smelled like highway paint, wet and heavy,
as winter wind but we never thought to tell
my father about that."
