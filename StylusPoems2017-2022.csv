"Out amongst the weeds
and the flipper-frill willows
We suddenly awoke
upon a green and brown pillow

Our heads were abuzz
with the wicker wisp tunes
As they danced from our bed
And back into the gloom

Their small little lanterns 
Had the hallow alight 
with the magic of Wompas 
the mysterious sprite

And but a moment later 
As if from a dream
Came that greying old bastard
In a flannel and jeans 

Now what do you want?
He boomed with a grin 
Do you know who I am?
He said stroking his chin

I’m Wompas the Fairy 
He quipped with a whistle
I dance with the trees
And sing with the thistle 

We’ve heard of the stories
I said with a start 
They say you grant wishes 
To those pure of heart

So we’ve come for your blessing
I continued to fumble
We just bought a beehive 
Whose genus is ‘Bumble’

They won’t make you honey

 So what do you want 
From my ancient old ass

We wished for the health 
Of our bees in the end
We didn’t need honey

"I look to my brother, my twin,
suffering the same fate as I.
He commands us to part the ocean;
Moses, we need to be.
We have only our bodies, and
an endless deluge of water;
Sisyphus, we are.
We spend our days waiting for Him
to command us, slaves
to His desires. A necessity for Him,
an uncovering of His eyes.
Without us, He stays blind.
Loneliness is a terrible blindness.

And the ocean flows on, drowning
everything in its path.",
"As we leave the cream houses with red-tiled roofs
On the banks of the river Elbe
Dotted with gliding swans and moseying ducks,
The Gothic steeples towering over Meissen
Hearkening back to the days of ribbed vaults and
Resounding chants in minor keys,
The GPS lady develops a most atrocious
Case of laryngitis,
Starts choking and gravely regurgitating
Names with myriad guttural consonants

A young curmudgeon in the making,
You slam the brakes
Give the steering wheel a whack
And turn her off
―I don’t need a moronic machine
telling me what to do―
Rerouting onto a gravely country road,
You urge me to get outta the goddamn car
And check the cellphone signal.

A splotchy blood orange hovers in the sky
Squirting its crimson juices on the horizon.
Golden wheat stalks sway in the wind,
Brushing past my nose and sprinkling
Grains into my hair.
I’ve always been offended by plants
That have the audacity to grow
Taller than me

Having a vastly different bone to pick,
You whine
―We’ll never get to Bad Schandau at this rate―
Appalled at every slight alteration to your plans.
But maybe you’re a Bad Schandau for gracing us with
Your terrible navigation skills
And I’m a Bad Schandau for not helping.

When the syrupy ochre pancake rises in the sky,
I start cackling like a ludicrous lunatic,
Managing to blurt out
―Look, it’s a honey moon―
In between my wheezing teehees.
With a patronizing scowl,
You assure me that there will never be
A honeymoon,
I can just forget about it,
And that you’re sleeping in the car.

I lie down in the field,
Sinking into the crackling dry grass,
Gazing at this appetizing ceiling above
That looks like it’s dotted with vanilla sprinkles,
Realizing that I haven’t eaten since morning.

You know what…
Maybe it’s okay that we’re not
In Bad Schandau right now,
Because I kind of
Sort of
Forgot to make a hotel reservation anyway.",
"Away from home… and then all at once 
not. The midnight heart-to-heart

happened before we could let it.
You decaffeinated everyone else,

poached the elephant in the room,
each half of this conversation

existing only in our heads for months.
We texted once over Christmas break.  

You never pictured your bracelet changing hands,
its meaning spilled over, transferred to me.

Transferal to Boston, to block parties,
to living like your little brother.

To think of years spent on opposite shores
almost linked by two mutual friends then

finding out you were always looking out,
each little secret bundled up higher and higher.

Two decades as strangers eroded in months.
Landmark cigars and late-night 30 Rock. 

And then, lying beached on your bedroom floor
and the look of recognition on my car seat.

Walking back from the bar like middle-school 
friends, zigzagging from orexic laughter.

I drove home with one hand, the other miming
fullness, disbelief, thankfulness, somehow. ",

that these blue strands across my skin are not
the veins that they appear to be but rather
barbed-wire, that digs and cuts its way into me.
He was surprised by my tear soaked eyes,
and by my skin, which was bruised by life’s needles—
boring their way through me, into my soul.

When moonlight glinted off my smile, fake like
his, he saw my broken body. His lips
fell and formed a little “oh.” I cried “go.”

And then I watched him fade away into
the dark, despairing night. He left without
a backwards glance
as he fled my sorry house.",
"Oooh noooo it’s a ghost
A cold, sexy
Hot lil ghost
Right here in my home

I’ll say your name 3 times 
So that you appear behind me
And give me that 
ghosty good good

And then I’ll climb up
Up under that dirty sheet
And let you slink around 
My haunted halls

No priest necessary 
Just me,
you,
And a whole lot of plasma",
"A red cover,
beaten, corners
no longer sharp,
holds a collection of poems
once visited by the ink
of my watchful pen.

Your hands held the same copy.
Your eyes devoured those same words
in pursuit of that right
combination of syllables— the ones
that would finally satiate your hunger.

Beside me in class,
you wrote notes in the margins of my copy
as I scribbled dreams in the blank spaces
between your stanzas. We never could fill
the gaps between us

so we left our story unfinished.

Now, your book sits
dusty and deserted
on the closet shelf.

You stumble across my memory
in the same way you stumble upon that
forgotten red book
when you’re looking
for something new to read.",
"They say you just rose out of
The marsh one day
With soggy overalls
And a wide-brimmed hat,
Salt crystallizing on your
Caterpillar-lookin’ eyebrows.
You blew your nose just a little
To get the algae out
And gave the world a crooked
Whiskey-stained grin.

The sun comes in through the
Weeping trees lined with
Spanish moss,
The rays landing right on
Your forearm.
You look down and
Flex your wrist,
Making the tattoo of the
Lobster-lookin thing move its
Pincers.
―It’s a crawdad―

You explain with a
Raspy croak,
As if this very distinction
Makes the world go round.

I never understood how you could
Live in such a
God-forsaken place,
Getting up before dawn
Just to go make clucking
Squawking noises
Out by the water,
Waiting until the herons
And egrets answer back.
How you collect
Broken banjo strings
And let them coil up in a jar
Because maybe one day
They’ll help you pick out
The sand granules
From between your teeth.

The air is oppressive

Steamy and wet,
Forming layers on my lungs.
Your soulful humming ceases
And your elbow jabs at my ribs.
―God-forsaken?!
No, my good fool―

You yank a dripping blade of
Grass with your calloused fingers
And hold it up.
―This is God’s sweat,
That white egret over there
Is an Angel,
And this is the closest to
Them you’ll ever get―

So when the sun sets
Over the morass and swamps
And the mosquitoes start
To swarm,
I know that I’ll still find you here,
Sloshing on the edge of
Paradise that’s

Sunken in the Delta.",

"An ode to my grandmother
And her huge Sibley bird books:
Black-capped chickadees sing,
“Chick-a-dee-dee-dee, Sweet-ee”
As the conductor begins

To rouse an orchestra of
Songbirds into symphony,
It’s philharmonic flight.
“Jay-jay-jay” “Tut-tut” “Chirp-chirp”
Now her birdfeeder is a stage.

She points out first chair favorites -
Red-winged blackbirds pause to prune
Rounded ruby shoulders.
They’ve dressed sharply to perform
For us, captive concertgoers.

This is how we pass the hour,
Pulling guides off the shelf and
Spying a Schubert
Between the pages together.

They say
My stanzas stand,
Emaciated.
Made of words that waste away.

But be honest.
Who still reads
Contemporary poetry?

A search history of synonyms, similes, and
Spoken-word syllables: all a ceaseless spew.
The dictionary’s
‘S’ section, stolen.
Thus, I strike back— ‘academic dishonesty.’

‘My sin, my soul’
The tongue taps its tip on the back of my teeth
Stumbling down stairs,
‘Lo-lee-ta.’
But why stop there—
Such simplicity?
Showcase your skill, savor the spotlight.
Shameless self-indulgence? No,
They salute the excessive.

Fools pretend to be Shakespeare.
So they’ve dropped sonnets, ditched meter.
In lieu, the modern poet asks:
‘How many
Aching-archaic-adverbs
Can I squeeze?’
In a single stanza
Of a poem about a love, never had.
In this consonance epidemic,
I stand alone.
And while Hemingway called it concision,
I say it’s sobriety.",

but I will not start.
Like the 2006 Hyundai Sonata
that my mother calls Bella,
beautiful, I will wait until 
the air is thick with cold 
to stall—for my engine to blow
in the middle of February 
during a storm on 476, 
no blankets or gloves
to protect from the bite 
of the piling snow 
on my windshield. 
I will watch it cover
and clump until I 
can’t make out the 
mile markers anymore.
I will turn and turn
my key, the one with 
my mother’s St. Christopher
keychain, but there will be nothing—
only enough power

an apology, 
and a tow on the way. ",
"These beaten and broken kicks

notes, verses, and sets,
so many that the leather
had begun to deteriorate
decades before they were
passed on to me.
The laces are frayed, 
split at the ends like
the quarter-inch cables
you used to plug into your bass;
you’re lucky it didn’t explode.
You wore these on stages, 
in bars, on sidewalks and streets,

"Across state lines, there’s a lot more
bloodshed to be found, I’m sure, but 
children– the ones big enough to drive cars and push pills–
declared that this particular crime scene was holy ground.
Every teenager in Akron has at least driven past it,
fought with a girlfriend in the passenger seat about 
getting out of the car to look around that yellow
house, slanted such that it seems it’s always sliding.
Inside, Hicks’s gold watch, a shaggy haircut, and 
Jeff’s only crime in Ohio, but all the same, a
killing place. The withered southern couple who bought it know now, 
lining the sunken yard with steel fencing, that no
matter how many coats of paint you slap on it, 
no one can remodel Dahmer Street. 
Once, a group of boys riled by rumor and Smirnoff 
placed bets on the first to find the murderer’s old hut.
Quiet early morning in early July, 
rustling left-over leaves behind the house, they 
surrounded the so-called shack, only to find
trees. Albeit a grouping of them, but still just trees, and 
under the white-hot moon, some seventeen-year-olds with
vendettas so misplaced they didn’t even know 
what they were angry about. I don’t know what they expected to find–
X-Acto knives, maybe, an exhibit of 
young bird skeletons he’d collected, or 
zip ties, if they were lucky. ",
"It was a scavenger hunt of the heart, 
One where teams were formed amidst the search. 

Mom and Dad found you in hikes along waterfalls 
And car rides blasting Jesse's Girl;
In last minute midnight confessions and rejected proposals. 
No longer a scavenger hunt but a game of Poker, 
They were willing to risk it all if it meant gaining each other. 

Robin and Thomas found you in athletic passion 
And naps that formed indents on mattresses; 
In the quiet of absent older sisters and the overcoming of overbearing mothers. 
Gone was the hunt replaced with Uno,
Their holes now filled with the one. 

Lily and Jack found you in holy scripture
And in an old movie’s lyrical lemonade;
In first times at cafes and matching lightsabers.
You transformed into a classic: Checkers,
Easily won and simple enough to not screw up. 

I, alone, found you in chilled damp graves
And shriveled hearts of long ago lovers whose ashes are now eternally mixed; 
In the shriveled petals of unwatered flowers and the smoke of blown out candles. 
You were murdered in a bath of blood by Clue,
When I wanted to perfectly write you out like Scrabble’s oxyphenbutazone.

And from your decaying mouth came spiders a plenty, 
Swiftly crawling up my aching spine. 
Whispering webs of potential truths: 
That you were never meant for me,
Nor I for you.",
"Last night I dreamed I was running
across the ashen craters of the Western Front.
The enemy had retreated and the doctor
told me that a Body had died.

“All are buried or home for tea
but a doctor works in between.
The war is won, and I am done.
And so It is.” Somebody’s son.

I ran for hours like a Peloponnesian
through the black earth stricken
by gas, and over trenches
as wide as the Rubicon,
choked with piles of singed meat
decomposed too fast.

Until,
by the shadow of a tree,
reclined like a Caesar
in the mortar-tilled dirt,
I found the Body.

“Oh, thank God almighty,”
the pallid Body said,
“you came here to save me!”

you tense in
my jaw.

You say my name like it means something. 

Let me return the favor, 
split your beauty 
into syllables
so that I can swallow
you. 

Want to see you. 
Undressed, 
façade folded neatly
at the end of my bed. 
Stripped to your bones— 
	Would they be shell,
like the mussels I 
collected in summers 
at Lake Yliki? Or 
magma, molten rock 
that melts the skin
off my fingers
as it slips from
my grasp?— 
left with no theatrics, 
no disguise, 
nothing but the heat
pooling behind 
your eyes, ready 
to devour flesh

lose his mind in the
depths of space,

He screamed at the Sun,

ignored him, a cold, impotent dwarf.

So Pluto howled loud
so all could hear,
FUCK THIS!

Sun, breaking all the barriers of 
sound, time, and space.
The Sun didn’t even get a chance

if I didn’t run away?
What if I stayed,

seized, took me
and my people
and my clothes?

Am I complicit?

How did you 
know when 
to escape? 

Did you buy a ticket
overseas before 
or after the first 
bomb dropped? 
Did you wait 
to see if they 
were bluffing
before you 
uprooted?

How do you ask 
for shelter— 
what if they 
don’t want 
to let you in?

What if they see you
covered in blood
and think you 
drew it? 
Regardless 
of the source

it is your fault 
it is yours. 

If I cannot flee, 
is that consent? 

And if I am able
to flee, after all
that I’ve seen, 
how do I go back
to before?

To before the bombs
and the freeze and 
the way that it burns  
your neck and the blood
the way it clings to your clothes
and your skin that you can’t 
take off, but you keep trying
you’re trying, but even when 
you’re clean you swear that 
you can still see it crusted, 
now brown, under your finger-
nails and what if you were
never really clean to start with?

No new messages just a hollow clatter.

Your phone at home again. I can’t reach 
You. It was always a hassle trying

of waiting for you. Do you hear me? Call 
me when you get this. Call me back

I’ll get back to you. I’ll get back to you. I’ll get back – 
Sorry. I couldn’t - get back to you – back to you. You. Leave

"The old house won’t sell,
It’s been up for ages.
Dozens of viewers,
A pushy agent,
No offers.
I think it’s because of the stains.
There are stains everywhere in that house;
In all the rooms on the walls, the floor,
Even the curtains are full of them. 
I see them most on your old chair,
Huge blots of sadness sunken into the leather,
No one wants to sit on sadness, 
It smells.
Mum says she doesn’t know what I’m talking about,
But she does.
I’ve seen her staring at them before 
on the photo frames in the corridor as you come in the front door. 
They’re bad there as well, 
Almost so bad that you can’t look at the photographed faces for too long 
Or your eyes will start to sting.
We’ve tried a few different cleaners, 
But even after all the scrubbing and steaming;
You’re still there.
I think you always will be. 

You’ve stained my life as well,
In a much bigger way than if it were just
With tea or tears,
I hope you know that. 
A stain so big it’s burnt through my fabric,
Like bleach through clothes catching the skin,
Drills through teeth touching the nerve - 
I always feel you.
In big moments,
I feel sick
Because you’re missing them.
In small moments, I think about the big moments you’ll miss. 
So many moments you’ve missed and will miss. 
Sometimes I feel consumed by it,
Like you’ve eaten me and taken me with you,
Wherever you went.
I worry sometimes that the stain will wash away,
That you’ll come out in sneezes or something,
And I won’t be able to remember you as clearly.
Maybe that’s inevitable.
For now though, the stains are stuck 
To the curtains of our old house 
And the insides of my eyelids as I sleep.",

drops sliding from the barman’s forehead,
like rain on filthy windows in the attic. 

Flashes of muted TVs flustered
the claustrophobic hovel I was dragged into,
disorienting my symmetrical thought. 

I smelled mediocre lives passing by, 
and locked eyes with foggy minds that danced
with faint fuzzy smiles.

up front,
I just couldn’t give it up.

and my arm reached behind you to turn up 
the burner’s dial: 
400 degrees.
You writhed, feeling its heat, and I watched and sobbed.

I could have taken a step closer, 
let the tears extinguish,
pulled at your charred remains and
dusted away the ashes. 
I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry.

Instead, I took a step back and watched you
like you were a Hawaiian sunset,

"I sit here, embracing that special strain
Of mortality late at night,
Like catching a falling knife.
But suddenly it was you

And now I resort to grasping, reaching
With marled and infected hands
For the rope of reality to pull me out
Of this involuntary stream of consciousness.
I was fine to stew in death
And marinate in imagined emotion for the future.

But memories,
Memories once again bring me intimate with collapse
And I float away like a loose balloon
Into the vast, unending horizon
Of my discontent.",
"Once there was a person who said to me in a mocking yet not unserious tone: ""There is only one God.""  I was in disapproval.

 The Buddha statue was rolled in a towel and slept in a cardboard box. When it was taken out again, the paint on the eight corners of the base was reduced.

 I placed it carefully in the storage cabinet next to the bathroom, alongside the cheapest items: bicycle cushions, nylon cable ties, and some disposable bolts. Detergent and soft towels folded into squares, on the other hand, lie quietly under them.

 In doing so, I carefully separated it from the Gideon's Bible. 

To avoid interference with each other, the Bible was placed high up on the bookshelf.

Today, I took out the Buddha again.

At the top lies the heart: le Sacré Cœur – you can climb it
if you dare – swirling staircases leading to a pillared dome.
Grape remnants taint my breath as I ascend.
We emerge together – all of the city opens
beneath us. Drink it in you say and I pull in a breath of air
imagining the view to be wine; my lungs
hold it tight. I’m fearful
if I exhale all the bâtiments will crumble away.",
"Flipping pages in the dead of night,
I rub my drooping eyelids. 
The crickets chirp outside,
And I know that they’re laughing.
A bucketful of chuckles and scorns
That perhaps we may deserve,
And a sudden revelation
That I’ll never fall asleep alone. 
 
The lamp still shines on,
Making a sharp fizzing sound,
A crack every now and then
A pop.
Let the light crack as I crack.
Not a soft glow,
But cold fluorescence
Fit for the institution this house has become. 
 
The bed seems to be getting narrower
Each day.
The Mattress Eater―I call it.
Comes in the daytime and bites off
Chunks when I’m not there. 
There’s no space for you beside me anymore.
Don’t bother coming in and trying to sit―
You’ll fall right off the edge.
 
Absence intrigues me because
You weren’t really there to begin with.
The smog that infiltrates the mind
And thickens with each passing hour,
An inattention to light and breath and sound.
What did I just say?
I bet you didn’t hear. 
 
You have a gift for saying what you do not mean,
A talent
For painting blizzards on white canvas,
An aptitude for hide and seek. 
 
So go forth
And hide behind those bushes,
Clamber up that tree.
But when you get to the top
Don’t bother looking down at me. 
 
The blinds are drawn. 
The window is shut.
And the crickets are laughing.",
"Pointed tusks of ivory
And splintered shards of
Whittled bone,
Butchered skin
And blood-soaked hides
That rot in the dense jungle.
The Giant has fallen
Along with the
Muffled
Strangled
Trumpeting of Kings cut down,
Cornered criminally across the
Coveted continent.
Can you hear the cries,
The heaving and final sigh
Just before the body lies still?
Can you see the pools of stifling crimson
Dotting the savannah,
Sinking into cracks of parched soil?
Does your gun grant you governance over
This sacred ground?
Have you gone
Deaf
To the screams and
Blind
To the struggle of the abused?
Look into that bloodshot eye and tell it
That it deserved to die.
Wipe the tears wetting the leathery―

Hide.",
"because i was fascinated by repair— 
with the way that the women in my family
choose to handle 
the brokenness of men.
My Pop-Pop, as i knew him,
was a saint— 
but first he was an alcoholic 
who ripped his slacks stumbling out of Don’s
on a Sunday afternoon.
Traipsing down Chester Pike 
like Dionysus in Thebes,
dressed in stranger’s clothes,
trying to convince the town 
he was worthy of praise. 
But they did not believe— 
all failing to see the demons 
he bore like Bacchae,
save for my grandmother
who saw his demons and tears 
                   and said, Harry— 
taking her sewing kit
                   and the god’s name in vain 
and patching up his polyester,
her irises honeying his reflection 
until he could recognize himself again. ",
"to the brick that bore me, 
pushed me past clay and shale and drywall
into a bathroom whose steel faucet never ceases— 
It drips
         and drops
but rarely carries warmth.
That flows from my mother,
from her dreams of a home with a high ceiling
and a Christmas light display 
to rival that of E. 20th Street— 
far from Bethlehem,
but leaning towards its ear with whispered prayer,
         for a home where faucets never leak, 
         where the booms that echo on darkened streets
         are always just fireworks.
 
I could take you for a drive 
around the landmines that line our highways, 
through thoughts polluted
by the cloud factory smoke
that seeps into our lungs during the afternoon cortisol rush.
Potholes littered across road fragments 
drive even the agnostics to pray, 
         let this labyrinth of construction lead home
         and the mechanic be right about wide sidewalls preventing tears.
 
Mostly,
I wish we could go
just past the trafficked frenzy of the I-95 
to the park where children gawk at planes 
set to land on runways where every passenger is departing
         or wishing they were.
Yet the children see divine— 
like all planes lead to Bethlehem,
to the promise of seeing loved ones lost
to faucets that leaked and flooded them 
into the Susquehanna, 
         without prayer, 
         but still home. ",
"I.
when we didn’t understand what it meant to say I love you, you’d braid
violets into my curls. there was a patch of them in the woods behind
the lake where we’d bike on summer nights helmets off hair spiraling
behind us. band-aid bruised knees and dirt under nails, you splayed me
in your lap, wild locks billowed out, and you built me a wreath of violets.
 
I always followed you down to the creek to splash around
barefoot bare skinned with nothing but the sound of the marsh,
my harmony to the melody of your laughter. you clung to
the covenants that fell from my lips as I fell into a drunken stupor
of love. love like the camellias blooming in my grandmother’s garden.
 
II.
when you first told me I love you my heart flipped in my fissured rib cage,
I said it back. you’d go on to love pale lattes and boys in volleyball uniforms.
you’d love cruises across the ocean and catching flights late into the night.
you’d love French baguettes, German trains, and other people. I’d think I
loved someone else until you whispered you still had my letters, etchings
of my love you–love you–love yous burnt into your childhood desk draw.
 
I left your words suspended, but I sent you snapshots
of lavender bushes on my walk home. I returned clipped
photos of green carnations pinned to sweeping dresses
and finely tailored suits paired with your highest heels.
 
III.
I always find you in the language of flowers.
our last few years were spent passing portraits of calla
lilies and pansies. I’d’ve given my soul to hear your
voice, but your body sleeps in the land down under.
 
when your face appeared in front of a flag, fuchsia violet bluebell,
I knew we’d fucked us up. I typed out two hundred ways I loved
you, but hesitation had me deleting the way I’d described your lips.
adults can mind their own damn heartbreak without bringing up
echoes buried in hollowed out trees where our names are etched.
I could try and give us a chance to finally let this go. to let you go.
 
IV.
the text you sent me as doomsday overtook Europe
let me know that I still love you. it let me know
that you might still love me. but you’re stuck down
in Sydney, floating out to sea and I’m standing
in the rain to watch rayo flicker across Quito
as mother nature weeps for what she has lost.
it’s not the right time for us. our time is dead.
 
when I said I wanted to marry you,
they told me that little girls didn’t grow up
to marry other little girls. now, I think
that little girls grow up to marry other little girls,
but maybe I don’t grow up to marry you.",
"to the last Poʻouli: no kau a kau
 
Poʻouli once roamed the north-eastern
slopes of Haleakalā and nested aloft
in the ʻōhiʻa lehua, a flowering evergreen
tree native to Hawaiʻi and her islands,
feasting on olapa berries and waxworms.
 
sounds of rain pittering along silversword
vegetation as the Pueo, the guide of ancestor
spirits, and hallowed, paramount honeycreepers
flitting above evergreens and invaders around the
crater, all ache for the loss of one of their own.
 
eleven weeks before the endling died, one half-blind
and lonely songbird found itself in a battle against
Papahānaumoku and Wākea, his earth mother and sky
father. humans, always trying to race eradication. that
night the heartwood wept for its beloved, far from home.
 
even those devoted hands, warm to the touch running
down soft, gentle feathers, couldn’t nurse him out
of extinction. time is a coup d’état: cruel and swift
colonization of the body as is the illness permeating
his bones, weak and anemic, atrophies beyond repair.
 
they don’t bury the body in volcanic soil, no return
to his ancestral homeland. rather, he remains pressed
in between sheets of plastic in the ice cold. shipped
to some distant mainland to be poked, prodded
until there is nothing left but the chill of death.
 
they never named him but his song resonates
like a melodious Kalani, cold winds reaching
upwards to the heavens residing above rainforests.
‘I’iwi and ‘Ākohekohe engage in a dance of grief

light scatters across the sky and it seems

village church. I am the product of the empire.
 
in the mine, I stared longingly at slabs of ore,
gold dust, and gemstones gleaming six thousand
colors. what would it be like to touch, taste history
again? in the mine, my brothers ran ahead, still

still dwell in the etchings of the desert’s
paintbrushes and spiny, sanguine ocotillo.

summer sundays, when the sun is ripe

in a midnight shroud, soft skin of stomach
and a flushed neck sprawl naked against
the judgement of the desert-soaked stars.

tears prickly pear bits into your skin.
there are gods you’ll hear rattling like
snakes along sandstone formations,
calling out a warning before danger.
there are gods you’ll see many times
on your path, and there are gods you’ll
see only once, gods you’ll embrace with
open arms and those you’d rather forget.
 
there are gods that’ll slither into dreams,
oleander-laced, gnawing life from your
bones sucking water from your supple skin,
pulling hair from your head. you’ll wake up
gasping, snuffed out by dehydration and cave
fires. these are the gods you’ll taste like ash
under your tongue. these are the gods you’ll
see in the smoke, phantom apparitions. these
are the gods that you can’t escape and can’t
escape you. gods you’ll see in the mirror.

Except that isn’t exactly true,

Hours of media

A shape with baby bird body and  hapless human head.
Greasy, amniotic, in need of a shit, 
Slouching along the now deep-worn ruts 
From A to B. Toward the next feed.

The pen, I read, is mightier than the sword.
There. I’ve passed on what little I know.
Go and set the world on fire.
I find I have little use for either tool. 
Each is but an egg tooth,
And I care little to meet that part of me which 
Cannot make itself known
Within the confines of my shell.

It struggles to understand much about the world without.
Color as a concept, for instance. 
Political particles displaying wavelike qualities.

The ecosystems they trap, and their

Of do-nothings have trod since

No matter what sound it makes, 
Whether it whips 
Through window drapes, sings 
Through a saxophone, or

From an ultrasound, straight from a tiny heart, 
That wind is but a function of heat.

To forget the word,
Bethlehem, and slouch instead from bed, to table, to church, to couch,
To toilet, to bed with little desire to be born.

In the common sense of the metaphor.
We cling close enough to the fruit 
For which the species was cultivated
to be shorn likewise from the field by

Whisked away with newfound freedom,
The memory of common soil purged. 
We think little of the stalks and stems,
and feel even less.",

Of hapless pine nut farmers to report on, 
In Syria, Iraq, Palestine,
Or perhaps in Nigeria,
In Yemen, or in Iran, 
In bloodied Crimean snowbanks, 
drowned below decks in the South China Sea.

Inverted from

You danced along the cliff’s edge

I followed
Because I didn’t want you
To jump.

After all

There’s no reason 
To repeat
A wanton act.

I can feel God pressing on my shoulders
He has knocked me over
And He lays on my back
Unashamedly.

Maybe I deserve this guilt.

I hear a rib crack
I feel myself groan,
But I do not move.
I wait for the moment of escape

I need it to Rain
To have salvation pouring from
The Heavens.
To watch the spirits
Gasp and
Sizzle away,
To no longer
Be haunted by souls
Long gone.

And maybe then
I’ll sigh 
Close my eyes
And scream.",
"you sit above me, flushed and mild,
rough midwestern thumb 
soft against the fleshy socket of my cheek

i’m on my knees- i’m always on my knees-
and i’m looking up at you 
and i’m saying with my mouth
“i am going to make you love me.”

and i do. i make you love me

in the sallow dark of autumnal yearnings",
"Suffering is sensational.
The more harrowing the better.
People will read it and
feel as though they understand.

“It’s a fine thing that,
being misunderstood.” 

Joy is so generic.
It’s campy and generic
and cloyingly sweet.

	expressed it just so.”",
"You obsess over the hiss  
of our moka pot, eager 
for a taste of pressurized 
bitterness, flowing naked 
across morning tongue.

Once, on a humid July day, 
you told me about how 
an Italian man insisted 
on making coffee for you;
how he didn’t wear grey 
flannel suits or speak 
hollowed language.

I recall this, poking 
the yolk sprawled before me 
with clinical precision, 
while you skim a drugstore 
copy of Anna Karenina long
forgotten in the credenza. 

Oh to be a scythe swinging 
Russian at harvest — what
sweet misery lies in silence. ",
"While she looks for a corkscrew, 
her bulldog is a pile of waterlogged laundry
on the kitchen floor, a hind leg stretched lazily 
like a lost sock not interested in rushing a reunion. 
His snores, like pennies plunked into a still fountain, plop 
beneath him and ripple through the stone. 

He looks angry from this angle. 

Outside, Bath is the same it’s been since I was born—
stubborn, only a little loud, sweet on the tip of your tongue
before your throat burns sour—
but my best friend’s bulldog is furiously sleeping a foot away,
and meaning plumes into the word hometown, as if I’d inhaled
after a storm, the air sopping and smelling like sorrow. 

A door closes somewhere inside me.
A door closes somewhere behind me,

"I stick my head into the grass
―Surprise, it’s me again―
Searching for
The golden kernels that fall from the stalk,
Clawing as they
Recede deeper and deeper into the soil.

I look up and bob my head,
Fluttering my wings indignantly,
Suddenly aware of your sickening presence.

You horrifying, treacherous thing,
Flapping your arms around,
Your mangled sleeves thrashing in the wind,
The uneven yellow fangs carelessly stitched into your face.
They are bared at me, 
Urging me to flee, 
And yet no sound comes out.

You never speak or yell or curse 
As you should.
You give me a deformed scowl and 
Let the wind sound your growls.

My beady eyes shift from side to side
And I caw at you:
―Why can’t you scream? Why can’t you shriek into the wind?
If you really hate me, 
Prove it!―

I flap my wing disparagingly at you, 
Slapping the hay shooting out from your sleeves,
A sorry excuse for hands.
I hear the hay rustle angrily.
How dare you crinkle those false limbs at me?

―Your entire existence is a fraud―
I squawk at you.
You have no power 
To protect the vegetation that lies behind you.
You simply spread negative energy,
Stifling the vibe with your face,
Like a decrepit clown. 

I shake my feathery black head.
You are a fool, and I am too,
For I have no reason to be speaking to you.

*

The little droplets of melted snow ooze into your
Wrinkled cloth,
Like hopeless tears
Staining the faces of the unloved.
You have been abandoned in the numbing cold,
Left to shrivel like a corpse.
The frostbite clenches down harder than your uneven fangs.
The wind whooshes louder than your crackling sprawled hay.

I land on your torn straw hat
And extend my scaly leg down,
Clawing and grasping at your felt eyebrows.
I tilt the brows upwards,
Turning your scowl into surprise,
Shock and hurt.

I bounce up and down on your threadbare shoulders,
Shaking off the mounds of chilling snow.
I crawl into the gaping hole in your left side
And settle into the tufts of stuffing.

I let out a rattled sigh. 
I guess I can stay here and keep you company for a bit,
But only a few waking hours, and that’s it!

*

The wind has knocked you down
From your post,
And I find you slipping into the 
Chunky spring mud.

This past year
After an ear-splitting shot 
Resounded through the air,
My partner disappeared 
In a cloud of blood and feathers.
Perhaps yours did too. 

I latch onto your pant leg
And pull and heave and sigh,
Dragging you through the slush,
Lifting you into the heavens
And onto a hole-covered roof.

A soft tutting noise escapes from my beak.
I cannot leave you in the cold as I have before,
Or else I know I’ll never find you once more.

Why wallow outside, 
Letting your insides fill with dread,
When you can stay in the barn
With me instead?",
"Sibilant and relenting,
The wind-wake abates
Around the roadbend,

Its remnants known only
In the shiver of the oak leaves.

A fingerprint of August,
Dusted by the stars,
Lies bare against the evening.

All is exhaled,
And for a moment, is breathless.",
"Dark motel rooms are a little like time machines— 
there’s something about being alone 
in that generic, indistinguishable room 
with sheets that are not quite white anymore
after drawing the blinds against the glaring curtain of the sun
that makes me feel like I might be anywhere,
or anyone for that matter, stripping away the years
like so many layers of dirty clothing until I forget
why I am here. Maybe I’m in another hotel room miles and years away 
listening to how my mother’s breath sounds like the ocean 
as she lies on her back, or the room with the shell box 
grinding out white noise to help me fall asleep, 
or the room laden with ocean-scented candles, 
a chemical replacement for that distinct blend 
of salt, sand, and sunscreen. I hold a shell against my ear 
listening to the waves sigh but I found out long ago it wasn’t real, 
just noise resonating between cold, hollow spirals
smoothed by decades spent tumbling in the surf
and to whoever explained away the mystery—
What do you know compared to the true believers?
Those who still put teeth under their pillows at night, 
who haven’t yet discovered the drawer 
in their mother’s vanity rattling with tiny, rotting teeth
smelling one to check if it’s yours, the acrid decay 
making you turn away, and I wish I could take it back,
the wonder of holding the ocean in my two cupped hands,
when I believed my mother’s breath
would be as constant as the tides.",

"Truthfully, this sadness is not worth much.
A couple nickels, maybe, a quarter on a good day, 
sloshing around the bottom of a receipt-littered handbag. 

I’m sorry, reader— 

no matter how many metaphors I weave this sadness into,
it’s only a few yards of fabric, not enough
to make something of it, but I am still sitting down to sew, 
every time imagining what the pain would feel like
if I pierced a needle through my thumb nail.

I’ve done it again, haven’t I? 

Really, this sadness is not worth much. 
Even if I hold it up to light and ask it
to project something sequined onto the wall, 
it’s just a slab of glass that
I’ve been holding onto for too long, 
generating enough pressure for it to splinter
into my palm, to slice
through my life line, and yet,

with the bass, dancing.

I was coming up on a ten-ounce coffee cup, 
lidless, unsupervised on a granite ledge. 
There was a bee– no, two– no, three, 
orbiting the rim, taking turns swan diving 
across the cup’s diameter. They must be competing
for sun-warmed globs of honey hung on the inner walls. 
Parallel to their apparatus now, my view angled inward to see 
bees, at least a baker’s dozen,
a handful of winged Cheerios afloat in baby pink sap.

by the years. You wear water plants
on your blouse, vines right off the wallpaper

we gaze through pond murk down to the tarp.
It is spring but nothing living remains,
the birds have ripped the net and stolen the koi,

The gargoyles were not enough to ward them off ,
neither was the stone turtle whose neck we painted red,

you spit out pollen. The day steams like the greenhouse
where they sold us reeds and lilies for this haven,
they lose their leaves in winter but can endure the elements,
and sure enough they lasted you out. The day I got word,
a moth lost its wings when I cut them off with scissors
and dropped them like white petals onto the surface.

grey words to you –

"I took some time today to think of the past,
set notes aside in the purr of a library, static
and surrounded by miles of answers living
in thousands of pages. One day I’ll read them,
I tell myself, one day I’ll retract this mind from
the fantasy I live in, and into the world of
another. The past. Driving down the 8-lane
by Mission Bay, the horns of metal beasts,
wild horses storm smoke through their noses.
Nick looks on passively, gripping the unsure wheel
in the stern countenance of a father dumbfounded
by what a librarian confi ded about his son’s
mischief. The Stones rattle through the scratchy
stereo, and the water breathes a foggy sigh through
rays of spring’s opening eyes. My feet lie on the lip
of the window, beckoning some Tahoe to blow
them clean off . Nick pays no attention—he looks
past the Bay, to the sea. I brand my brain with the
surreal distance of that stare, and the tacit pull
of San Diego. Somewhere in this moment is a
leash for the dancing tumbleweeds of my drive thru
concerns—tucked in a shelf,
dusted off on a tired afternoon.",
"No matter how good the prescription,
At the end of the day I still
Take out my contact lenses
And brace the world of wide shapes
And soft edges
Into which I was born.
My mother says the fi rst time
I opened my eyes,
I looked at my father;
I wonder how much of him
I really saw.
Tonight, after rain, droplets cling
Fast to my window-screen,
Shivering as they size up
The fourteen-fl oor fall.
I look at the car shapes zipping
From lamp to lamp
Like hungry moths.
When I turn my head,
The droplets catch my eye—
Hard to do with eyes
That wouldn’t catch baseballs
Pitched straight towards them—
Absorbing the brackish night
And close-arrayed,
They're birds,
Moving this way and that
As I turn my neck,
Off somewhere melting together.
I sleep and they sit
On the rooftops straining,
Dawn will light their bellies
And when I open my eyes
There will be nothing to see.",
"I.
The pain behind my belly button seeps
Into my bending spine and fatigued hips,
Down straining glutes and lats. My hairline weeps
A fl ood of salty tears in streaming drips
Through open eyelids, causing joy in heaps
As I discern a case for water sips—
If my sharp vision’s compromised, it keeps
Me from performing planks. I close my lips
Around a bottle, and my body reaps
The sweet relief. It nearly purrs and fl ips
On to its front to soothe sore abs. It sleeps
Its tiny triceps, delts, and quadriceps.
But while it rests, my eyes (still drowned, I swear),
Start pondering the other bodies there.

II.
A woman, crouched upon a foam mat, thrusts
Her leg into the sweaty air, spandexed
From straining neck to foot, upturned and fl exed,
As her gaze rises, glancing at the gusts
Of broad men blowing through the door. She shoots
Her foot up higher, dipping back to lift
A padded chest, while the newcomers sift
Through hundred-pound barbells to look like brutes
As their veins pulse and grunts escape their throats.
With arms ballooning, they seem fi tting mates,
In mirrors beyond sliding, glass door gates—
The women, too, in Lululemon coats.
But of the quick heart rates and pumping thighs,
I wonder if all beat for other’s eyes.

III.
Two hundred tan pounds perform a French press,
Between a super-set of goblet squats
And steel-bar weighted lunges—I bench less
Than this guy hoists with a forefi nger. Thoughts
Of shame mixed with self-loathing make me force
Another aching set; one Russian twist
In and I’m dead, a failed try at his course—
Two blistered hands, two puff ed cheeks blushing, dissed
By dainty dumbbells; meanwhile he deadlifts
Like a Romanian, chest forward, eyes
That scour his form, then spot some minor rifts
In others, pouncing on the weakest guys.
We think we’re tigers, cloaked in stripes and smells,
But we’re just prey in jungles of kettlebells.",

my waist, that elevator burned airy gold.

I’d mentioned more about my grandmother,

of sticky love. Our sun-colored fabrics,
the scent of yellowed books, worn spines, rainwater.

from there. I look through a telescope lens

I’m caught panicked with headphones over my ears,
music dims the loosest vision of my eyes ––
I know I’m dreaming. But for a moment I can’t erase
the mist that rises like a man out of sleep,
coming to realize himself in the seconds he breathes.
The song’s playing from your phone, I know that now,

and decorating our world with palm prints and breathstains,
hunched into our bodies, your glasses kissed with skin.
If our worlds laid atop each other, you could see us ––
claiming each brick with footsteps, lighting low fl ames

cinderblock walls and throats and spigots of sound,
we gnaw at each other’s teeth and our fi ngers tense.

give the shuddering my name, and call that love,

kisses,
The blood orange hue of your grandmother’s lipstick,
And the airiness of your father’s most genuine laugh.
Think of the feel of the tile on your best friend’s kitchen fl oor,
The smell of hay, two in the morning, and a slightly sunburned
nose.
Think of rooftops, hydrangea bushes
And the cool quiet of the antique store that you used to hate.

And I will talk to you about sitting beside someone on a beach in
the middle of the winter
Listening to the waves hush on to the shore
As they whisper about memories of a long lost friend.",
"When Chopin’s bland hands
Wrote music,
They wrote études,
Odd French entities with depth,
Not defi niton—
Their meaning was locked
Inside our fi rst piano
With strings and hammers.
Étude, in French, means study.
Webster was cruel
To ground great words
With ink blots.
I never pegged it for a study,
Not even when I twisted my face
At a note so high
It almost didn’t exist—
A puzzle or a parable
Or miracle;
A study it was not.
We are on our second piano now,
So glossy it shows me
My fi ngers when I play.
Behind the panels
Are a thousand strings,
Each straightening out
Some delicious mystery
All sorted—
The art of pronunciation,
Articulation,
Defamation.
I watch my hands grow old
In that brown mirror,
Showing my wrists,
Showing me words
In languages whose depths
I never touched—
Only believed in
When Chopin said
They might exist.",

in English, it means nothing
It is said in repetition, never
heard the fi rst time. It smells
like glue and rind. It holds
its sadness on its elbows.
It always leans. It forgets
that it can be a soft thing

ocean fl irting with nose hairs but every
summer when i’m sweating my skin off

peeling i wish for wind and winter and
crisp air in my lungs and walking indoors
to fall in front of fi re the burning wood

defrost and the hairs on my arms once
erect like soldiers begin to kneel begin
to honor the bitter cold the bitter sweet
the ice queen because winter strips us of
our sun so we remember he may live in
the sky but his home is in our bones.",
"Deep beneath his golden mane I felt

just a pocket of age within the hide.
But it grew to a golf ball, tennis ball, baseball

When my mother got wind she found
the shears to cut around the mass,
up to its edges which hadn’t crusted.

over your chest and broke through.
We walked together through the heart,
chamber by chamber, aorta hung above
us like a bulging moon, pressed against
fake muscle and modelled viscera, plaster
thumps of a beating heart. I can still
feel your biceps in my fi ngers, how
I held your arm like the humid dark

we bowed our heads to enter the atrium.

a history frayed and torn, mired in the deep sucking red clay.
Plug your ears squeeze your eyes lock your knees

You feel it when you walk barefoot beside the riverbed

It is the melody of the cicadas and the mockingbirds,
the weeping willows and the wide yawning river.

Your timely arrival causing a grin to spread across my face:
“Quick! Grab your rain boots!” and out into your presence to search for bugs.
Salamanders, rollie-pollies, the occasional beetle, and the unwelcome worm.
I called you ugly once, but I didn’t mean it,
I actually think you’re quite spectacular—really.
Paris, boats in the middle of the ocean, little apartments with old windows
That have seen more than the oldest turtle there ever was—
Rumor has it they take their sweet time kicking the bucket.
Shame, you sighed.
And you didn’t have to tell me why because I knew—
Always cursing the chemistry of things.
Howling into the night you asked me why it was:
Why is it, you questioned.
Why is it that I am apart when I fall, and crash to come back together again?
Looking at me with your eyes full of tears, and a little something that tasted like love.
You knew I had no answer to boast of
So you walked on.
And alas, you’re condemned,
Or at least that’s how you see it.
But I must say,
You sure do look nice when you fall down, down, down from the grayness

I stand amid all the excesses of the Alhambra, the soaring towers
and lions carved in loopholes, but they are too far removed from
themselves to catch in my throat
as this room does. The manicured shrubbery
and spiraling paths to secret gardens of the Generalife,
marble-flowered fountains and Washington Irving echoing
across Granada from above, a maze of white-bleached buildings –
these places do not cry out with the ghosts of Al-Ándalus
as this, little temple, little forgotten Jannah,
too insignificant to be preserved or destroyed,
left behind for the ever-spilling water to erode the painted diamonds
on these once-brightly decorated floors.

colored blood, de la sangre pura por supuesto, and baptized
in the soaring Capilla Real, at the altar
where Santiago stampedes atop Moorish
skulls, loping the heads off of infidels as if they were dragons.
This sanctuary stands in spite of such things,
in spite of its civilization’s fall, a testament
to what might have been while I, ignorant visitor,
un mozárabe, so to speak, have only a few moments
before España returns, in the form of other tourists
and I, suddenly intruder, step backwards out of the vanishing
Albaicín, and turn my back on the temple for the Granada sunlight.",

a sweater in my mother’s fridge as if that makes us,
well, us, and us wonderful. Money’s good as sand
here, with everyone doling out bagels for free
because they know my father—handsome eyes yours, yes,
like his—as if he’s dead, but he’s just at work, home
in time for dinner always. Like when I was a real
boy, nose exceptionally short, so little to hide. Now?

You’re getting bored, and I’m getting tired

but it makes me critical:
Your legs are long, but
your knees are wrinkly.
Your skin is golden, but
only because the sun is out.
Your mind is vast, but
only because it’s empty.
Finally, you start submitting
to the sun’s angry glare

your knees standing up
your dress slipping down

You’re so pretty I could die;
You’re so boring I could kill you.
The sun, too, starts to droop,
so your skin starts to lose its glow.
I’m trying to tell you how I feel
through body language, my eyes
cutting straight through your thin skin,
but I’m not making myself clear.
Finally, the sky is a violent violet,
erratic with streaks of sanguine, but
mellow with blotches of warm maroon.
It’s dark enough to see how mundane
you really are. You really are nothing
but a plain white dress.
My chapped lips still dripping, I try
to paint your cheeks and smear
your neck, body language telling you
to wear more red.
That way,
if the glass in my hand
slips, I won’t feel so bad
about staining your dress.",

Gaze out,
Their colors leaking into
Pools of dark purple
Underneath her skin.
To fill her hollow belly,
She gapes her mouth
And gobbles air,
Gulps and swallows whole
The growing gaps
And swelling space.
She licks up worried
Looks and smacks
Her lips, cracked and
Sticky from the
Syrupy taste
Of their stares.
Then she turns and
Slinks away, back into
The black and murky
Cave where she resides,
Pipe-cleaner legs bending
Under the weight
Of her own shadow.",

hands about a hesitant white neck, can read meaning

Only the most unworthy can foretell
the future: their own damnation. God

a worthy adversary, a competent conqueror, that I might lose
myself in the act of it: in the thrusting
of spears, the clangor and clamor of stone and flesh,
unarmored and pregnable before certain death, until I beg
him to tear me apart and adorn himself
in my vile viscera. I deserve nothing more.
Only spare me the close of these twelve tasks: I know not
what may become of such a man, still unpunished,
indestructible and iniquitous, if not intentionally so,
whose every guilt-ridden organ throbs
with memory of Megara, the way her dark hair curled
about my fingers as I killed her.
You petty puerile deities, you grasping gods, without
thought enough to consider the consequences
of making man with sinews like Apollo’s bowstring
and strength enough to split mountains across a strait,
all without the self-governance that should attend such skills.

like their tryst, I am all divine vitality, devoid of prudence.",

rather, a pawn by which you contend for Mycenae or worse,
a watchful wife’s plaything. Do I satisfy your lust

boars and birds and other beasts; this carnage does nothing
to sponge out that which I have already carried out.
Is that all I am, a bringer of destruction to be passed around
from king to god and back again, my self reduced
to blood and battles that are not my own? Strip away my
Nemean skin; I do not want it.
I am no man, merely a spear and strangling hands.",

cozied among sheets and shins.
Your eyelids, lingering like honey
running lengthwise along my sandy strands,

viscous with dim lamplight,
calling to my memory your mention of the color yellow.
I should have told you more about my grandmother,
who loved sun-colored fabric, foxglove flowers,
and chose lemon slush on days by the sea.
I should have described the scent
of yellowed pages on rainy mornings,

Their faulty buzzing audible
Since the jukeboxes were fake anyway
In a patched up vinyl booth, one of those places
Striving for a rose-colored version of the 50’s and falling short.

If I was going to get the chicken soup again, because that’s what I did
When we were fourteen...
Fingers traced lines through spilled table salt,
Granules stuck to skin and I
Strained my eyes to count them,
Anything
To see without seeing
That we’re not those kids anymore.",

like how it must feel to be
the last eaten in a basket of fries—
piping hot because there I was
among a mass that
he looked upon longingly,
but growing colder and losing that
oily, appetizing sheen as his
fingers graze past me each time
closing around and deciding upon
a multitude of ways I could be
better. Perhaps he wanted me
taller, more slender, of a lighter

he wanted me with something
melted over top so he could forget
it was still me under it all.

"It rained for years and years
And then it rained again.
And—it rained.
It rained on the flowers
And it rained on the leaves
And it rained some more.
It rained so much that the plants
Fell into a grey bark sleep.
I got inside of the rain
And watched from the firmament,
Which was an expansive, glassy plate
Lined with icy shards.
The gods of Genesis were there
Making the rain.
Some of them were drooling saliva
And others did Tai-Chi in the watery chaos
And they made the water float in the air,
Bound by no container but their fluid wills.
It rained across the entire United States—
Hawaii and Alaska were not spared.
It also rained in Mexico and Canada
On Mexicans and Canadians inside of them.
It rained on the wildflowers of the Sierra Nevada,
Which I have never seen
And it rained in the Arizona desert
And somehow it rained on my dead grandmother’s dog, Shadow,
Whom I have also never seen, in upstate New York.

He was standing on a mossy green brick when the rain hit him.

The rain covered the earth
With the thick mud-like substance
Composed of rain and molecules",

By the uterine sack of rain.
I passed through the membrane of the rain
And gazed with eyes saturnine
At it.
It also continued to rain.
We stayed inside
Playing Monopoly and eating popcorn
And the weatherman said it would certainly rain.
We stayed inside longer,
And sat around the oven
Baking delicious brown steam.
I was very proud of the rain,
So walked outside the inside realm
And I thanked it and worshipped it
And stood in awe of it
And I climbed up high to get closer to it.
It was a joy to be wet in the rain.
It was a joy to remove great muddy boots and wet socks
And lay them atop the heater to dry.
It became darker and rained harder and deeper into my mind
And I slept for days and days.",

his jangle and badger mothers for one more dollar.
I searched popsicles for stimulant grains. None.
Hunted the kaleidoscope menu for street slang
codes on the truck’s side: Snow Cones Rule!

Gave up my confession search in Roy’s bearded
Buddha face, serene. Same year Nirvana hit September
big—too cool for ice cream. Seething winters
instead. Roy hibernated in the back of his truck
for years, I thought. Didn’t see him at all until one
Christmas, driving to my dad’s place again—
passed that old truck in a Rockland Ave driveway,
saw a man with a caretaker’s fresh white beard
brushing snow from the windshield, clean and jolly,
wore a loving wife’s knitted scarf. Bingo weekends,
no doubt. Still found the time to drive the truck,

Pulling up to your house late one December night
We used to flinch when your windowpanes creaked
As the rain got its way, trailing down glass in streaks

As it wrinkled and sank down to cradle your face
I recall the clanking of your kitchenware
As I reached up to get it to prove I knew where
It is funny to think of your kitchen sink
No matter how dirty, Dawn bubbles shined pink
And there’s candy hidden in the empty flower vase
Your sister leaves hair ties all over the place
In your bathroom you kept a blowfish soap dispenser
Try as I may I can’t seem to forget her
In my dreams I lay back on her old leather couch
Wander the halls of that familiar house
I slide in socks across the hardwood floors
Run past the usual windows and doors
The trouble is, a small town can feel so alone
Sometimes I drive by but you’re never home.",
"Last night I dreamed in rose gold
woven among silky black strands of ribbon.
The gardens were cropped and rowed,
trimmed like a hedge maze,
posies precise and pinpointed.
I wondered if the fountain streamed waters of youth
and could it preserve me
the way it had this place?
If I could watch the dusty-gray rabbit
sift among clovers, sipping wine in spring air
at the banks of the canal, or sit among the richly
papered red walls, feet on marble floors, eyes
on the paintings of angels overhead
for eternity—would I stay and melt into the quiet walls?
In the garden, the women were frozen in poses
of quiet contentment and their faces were passive
as their lowered hands. Full cheeks couldn’t flush
with primrose color, and young foreheads over unlined eyes
would not fill the grounds with beaming life.
Each figure weathered with time
is haphazardly preserved in image,
but lost in memory, drifting softly from
the chateau doors, never their soles again
to pad along the marble floors.",
"Just before the credits slip down the windshield
making the open road harder to see,
I’ll pop in the ‘‘Tiny Dancer’’ cassette
so there’s something for after we drive off
into the distant fireball out West:
Piano that twinkles against the cooling mood
while people sit there for the very end of evening,
which swallows the now cola-colored screen
and smacks its lips at the fatigued ovations,
eating up even the half-popped kernels and
the story of you and I.
But you’ll only discover
how little it all means in small towns
where star power is made anonymous
by the glittered gown of the night sky,
and there’s no one left in Albuquerque
to tell you how to act,
or how to feel about reclining
the passenger seat for one more trip
into the folds of terra-cotta leather,
of milky almond skin.
Once I drop you off
at another square house on the tongue of Las Vegas,
you’ll look down at a pair of smoking rubber streaks
where, by then, I’d have punched the Countach into hyperspace,
and you will wait for the phone to ring “I’m home,”
until the TV screens a site familiar
to you, but this time dressed in red:
A vintage sports car off road,
my head flat against the woodgrain oak.",
"Like a little bride, I was allowed to select my own dress,
from a selection of cousins’, to be sure, but still
it thrilled me to draw fingers about the mass of chiffon and tulle,
pawing at lace so light it floated as my mother lifted one dress after the other
off the back of my bedroom door and handed them down to me.
I picked a yellowing, frilly ensemble with a sober Edwardian neckline. My mother
called it champagne, and elegant, and so I felt: a grown-up
Catholic lady, ready to join that coveted Communion line at Mass.
The day came in with sheets of rain, but no matter. I awoke pure, soul
white as my sister’s dress, in the closet next to mine.
Today, I thought, would be the most important day of my life,
and I was ready, having confessed the sum total of my sins
– sometimes, I’m mean to my sisters – and prayed them away.
This afternoon, I would be different. The how of it didn’t matter, the precise
moment bread would become flesh and wine blood – was it in my mouth
or before? Could I see it, or only taste the difference? – I would be made
holy, like the children in my CCD book with yellow light all about them.
We’d rehearsed it, sure, even tasted the unblessed
wafer, but the teacher assured us this didn’t count, only
bread, with no bits of Jesus blessed into it. The real miracle would take place
today, and, dashing from station wagon to church under cover
of my father’s umbrella, I splashed my shiny
plastic Mary Janes into every puddle.
I don’t remember the mass, only kneeling before
the old parish priest, who told a terrifying homily comparing Jesus
to a bloodied, suicidal hummingbird. Could Christ feel it
when we ate of Him every Sunday,
thousands of Catholics all about the world nibbling off little pieces
of Him? Though the wafer tasted of cardboard,
just like the unblessed one, my saliva
softened it into skin, and I accepted the difference.
Stepping tentatively towards the chalice, I closed my eyes tight, preparing
for that thick, salty, unmistakable taste, a taste I knew
from all those times I’d bitten my tongue hard enough to draw blood
or licked my scrapes after splitting my palms open
in the driveway, playing hopscotch.
But this, this was something else entirely. Tipping",
"the chalice back, I found it surprisingly heavy
and a mouthful of the stuff sloshed into the back of my throat.
I had already done it, screwed my eyes inward and puckered my lips
like a little old woman, before I remembered
with sudden contrition my mother’s instructions: no grimacing in God’s house.
Gnawing on my tongue as I slouched back in my seat,
I eyed dying Jesus behind the altar as if to ask
whether I had been mistaken, whether wine could ever
taste like blood, or I’d just been gullible enough to believe it would.
My sister beamed down the aisle with pride and puffy white sleeves,
a perfect cherub, and I wondered if she’d tasted
God, or just pretended she had. In my mother’s car after mass,
still clad in my crummy champagne dress, I decided
to tell my first lie.",
"Corn season is over
The stalks have been ripped from their fertile soil, its purpose
Now fulfilled until next year

Echoes careen down ventricles,

comes from where I am going.
I do not feel the rain.
I arrive on shoulder bone shores

inside.
She ascends the cartilage cliffs
where chalk white shards
fall and disappear into the deep.
She passes through.
Apologetically, she digs pockmarks with her pick

crackling broken bottles under their sneakers,
crouched behind amphitheater benches,
whispering their secrets,

lips and heavy tongues.

chaos born from our mishap.

We watched a hurricane of butterflies—
Chaos, born from our mishap.
They swirled, and took to the skies.

We birthed a hurricane of butterflies,	
a peculiar and prismatic aberration.

indignant at my absent air.

flipping my pages,
flapping my coat,
whipping the heat from my hands.

ignore the waves he paints across 
the roiling water, his rhyme in the leaves.

square in my face, he slaps my cheek,
tears up my eyes, shrieks right into my frosted ears—

"He walked slow, with heavy steps
And swaying movements.
His hands always dry and scarred, digging into the inside of his palm.
He moved with stiff, but messy motions
That made the keys tied to his belt loop ring as they hit against each other.
He stirred the dirt beneath his feet.
The dirt stuck in the creases of the bottom of his broken shoes;
The rubber ripped off the leather almost completely.
His one shoelace on his right shoe was always frayed.
He always had dark skin by his swollen eyes,
Swollen like he'd been crying,
Like he slept with heavy stones blocking the light from his eyes.
He smelled of stale liquor.
Liquor and old, cigarette smoke that never faded away.
I could've sworn he'd bathed in it every day.
But never did I ask him why,
Never did I even have the thought to.
Not until I saw him that one morning
Standing in the field outside my home room window.
He just fell back like he thought the wind would catch him.
His eyes caught mine for an instant as he flew towards the ground,
His hair lifted from the perspiring skin it clung to.
His lips parted like he was in shock,
But he in no way regretted what he'd done.
I was the only one who saw, but yet I didn't say a word.
I couldn't.
I just looked down at my pale, shaking hands,
With my nails deep in my skin,
Right at the moment before I heard the sickening, muted thud
Of his head cracking on stone.
I kept hearing it in my head, I still do.
His fallen hand, just in sight above the sill of the window,
Turned cold.
I saw his hand turn cold and blue and harden like plaster on wood
And I felt the need to grab it and shake it back to life.
But I knew it wouldn't help.
He remains still and I remain quiet.",

"I love the way the axel of his wrist
turns the vortex of space with a spoon
between our eyes. This moment is trapped on vinyl,
meditating like a mug on the microwave turntable,
somewhere in the background of our eyesight.
The kitchen light is dark.

My tongue catches me off guard when I tell
him that I love him. The timer shatters, and the light
of the microwave like the nebula in his iris 
disappears across the event horizon.

I’m reminded that I define him by what he isn’t. 
We cannot understand each other with our skewed gaze.
The mug of waning moonlight doesn’t warm my hands
like I hoped it would. He remains outside my atmosphere.

But later, in the fractured bedroom mirror,
he bucks his palm into my chest. I let him pile drive my heart
until it collapses in on its own density and his weight locks into my hip 
and the shrinking space between our lips cuts off the morning sun. 
A moment passes and with new air in my throat, I glance, glacier-nosed

deflated and collapsed—for a brief moment you didn’t know if God was real but you 
prayed nonetheless. or maybe you freeze upon realizing that it could be
your excuses for your shaking hands. for when you shot upright in bed and sweat clung

war.

throwing itself against the notches of your ribcage. 
he split a pomegranate between your legs. Persephone screamed when you 
could not.

stone. it wasn’t better—but it was better. 
Medusa, turn me to stone. numb me until

I could crush it into dust,
Scattered into the wind,
Like ashes drifting from a pyre.

when it’s gone?
Will I feel the ache,
the empty cavity, the gruesome hole?

Perhaps I will fill it
Plant flowers to grow.
But what if the vines grow too strong
And wrap around my ribs
And reach out
And strangle my heart?

So, perhaps I will catch a snake
and slip it inside
fangs to protect me
coiled to strike.
But what if its venom 
seeps into my blood
and it sheds me
like another skin?

Perhaps I will fill it with dreams,
but no --
dreams have an emptiness of their own.

So I reach back inside
and return the rib.

heady afternoons in the glow
of a humid twilight where she sleeps 
a woven bamboo pillow beneath ropes 
of dark hair, damp tendrils curled 
the faint click of the metal door
when he comes back

streams of sunlight pooling
on ashen carpet, across the thick
comforter tucked under her chin
eyelids fluttering as I trace letters
on a plastic tablecloth
voices reverberating through
white wood. his voice echoes
her eyes are open 
and he loves her, it is true

what I know
is possibly nothing but
fabrication, sliced across
raised voices and implausible reconciliation
the one time I saw her, legs curled
on the floral loveseat
waiting, I thought, for the world
to begin rotating again
and even now:
I would not want

"I am not the hero of the skeptic. 
Have you ever felt his wasteland in your soul?

You could never feel it at all—the static screen, the senseless Novocain, 
a sweet high giggle of denial.

No, I was the child of Doubt, my daughter, 
differing on indispensable genes—

see the weakened sugars linking helix to helix, 
faltering in the slight microbial breeze;

Doubt—that is, love confounded by its object—
pulling apart the scroll in every cell

and souring organelles—though every one tries. 
Every atom tries to write itself aright again,

to find and fix the fatal locus 
where the question leaves the answer unexpressed.

The problem recessed into chromosomal comfort so small
you would think I couldn’t feel it at all

though it split me in two—
gave me skin that needed touch, eyes that had to watch, else could not believe.

Why shouldn’t it be Doubt breaks us 
in horrible haploids, down to the bases?

It is a loss of mingling, combination,
dear chiasmus, crossing maxims dear.

I got my diagnosis from my Second Thomas,
I got my diagnosis in the mirror:

Fatal?  I asked,
In how many cases? How soothe, how cure? 

Autoimmune? Genetic?—or did I touch
a chemical once?

How long can I live 
before I’m unwritten in two, 

a doubting me, a doubting you, 
your senses at my throat, my faith at yours? 

Must we take blood?—and Whose?—
and where to prick, with what results? 

What will I see?
Can we kill Doubt before Doubt kills Me?

He told me: I am Didymus,
We’re same, except there’s two of us. 

Your pain is mine—we have two minds
and twice the same unfit solutions. 

But two’s too many for a soul,
so we’ll perish till we are 

a single cell, a single side,
a sole relief. And since we are 

the same, we wept our matching tears
for one another’s unbelief.",
"Go to the square and tell me if he’s still there,
the body ever present in my mind:
one of the Twelve they clubbed the other day,
stretched in the dust like a map
I couldn’t read,
whom no one had taken away.

Go see there mangled
Jude Thaddeus’s back so blackly bruised
it minded me of heaven,
dark and twisted before the earth was born, 
vacant violent purple-blues
in galaxies of flesh,
a knotted sky swelled with blood and bone.

Now he doesn’t cry—
there’s wordless desperation scrawled 
on his skin robbed and robeless,
where clotted fire links his endless nebulas,
where in his face there burns a cosmic
sympathy for night.

I must’ve known his bruises all my life.

Go search and see
if evening falls on the martyr-corpse,
my thoughts revolving on him 
as bands on planets;
tell me if the sunset dyes his skin 
to make his violets shine hope-green,
tell me if his open eye still dances 
like the first horizon’s star,
like a nascent blazing set upon the dark.",

Newton-tattooed garbage bin

forgotten eggshells and 
metallic scraps that were once seltzer

candy-corn-like chompers,
big enough for your furry body
to squeeze through just enough
for when I peak my head out of the kitchen window, 
I see your stripped tail hoist like a surrender flag  

A child bobbing for apples, 
you move in and out of the Jack-O-Lantern carving,
moments away from finding tonight’s dinner
Will it be my Tuesday’s lunch of orzo 
 that ends in your grimy paws? 
Or perhaps my Sunday Brunch 
of wheat toast with raspberry preserves? 

My housemate says he hears you 
every night
from his first floor bedroom window
where tops of the green and blue plastic cylinders 
look like mountain peaks when he sits in bed

From the third floor, 
I am never lucky enough 
to hear you as I flick through tv channels, 
but I know you are there

His fingers gripping the edges of 
The balcony, their tips
White with pressure.

Light combs through 
Mahogany hair that plasters a face
Where two dull angels weep.
Where limp, lifeless lips
Hang over a forgotten smile
And sorrow wades in rivers that
Rush down ruby hills.

Below him, a crowd 
Lingers, listening as the wind 
Serenades them with its sweet songs of spring.
He cannot hear them
But they hear him.

“I don’t want to live anymore!”
His screech lurks, haunting the air,
Disenchanting the people below and hanging still as 
They scatter away

Teachers push past 
“Go to class,” they spit
“Don’t say a word,” they growl 
I walk away but the boy’s cries still stab

Back inside, the halls have become jungles.
Leopards with Adidas paws
Speed past blood-red lockers 
On the hunt for someone to tell
For someone who will listen 

While I enter a classroom 
Lousy with the laughter 
Of boys and girls 
Ignorant of the dark realities 
That prowl just outside the door

Silently, I take my seat 
Next to Josh’s sister, waiting
Until the teachers come
Until that darkness slithers beyond the door
And comes to get her",

a one lane mountain made my skin singe

fed me juicy bites as we sped, deciding 
fresh peach ice cream wasn’t exciting enough 
you mixed in chunks of peaches, skinned and 
bitten from our stash. They were meant to 
last the ride but survived barely longer
than my mom's rhubarb in the snow. Plants 
fill the grated holes in my heart and 
that’s why - the day I tried to shred our love - 
I brought you a cactus. Home Depot is 
a cavern where I’ve cried on paint chips and 
called out, waiting for the echo 
of peaches on lips and juices

of summer days with ancient neighbors; 
of playing in the garden and grooming their dog;
of their sloping yard and the immense creek. 
Sometimes she would take me to the water’s edge 
and sip as she dipped her toes. I remember 

the day she poured me out, an offering 
to the fragile fish who were thirsty, 
a tithe for the tide, meant to share her joy 
and expand mine. I mixed with the water, 

saw crawfish and tadpoles and more. 
Shared my pulp with the shore and 
my sugar with the silt and let myself settle 
to the bottom of this shrine. I stared 
up through a glittering new window,

slipped into early on the coldest days. 
Comforting, known, surprisingly 

durable. It’s been washed and wrung 
and hung to dry and even though mom 
thinks it’s unbecoming, I can’t stop wearing

it. Today my face is fog as I lean across
reality to pop zits in the bathroom mirror.

of the heaps of anthologies 
on whom I heap apologies,

because there are too many 
good poems to read them all through. 

Every month, another slew 
of well-designed covers 

trendy fonts on pleasant colors,
and someone’s life’s work,

side-by-side with a fruity graphic novel—
a tragedy for my distracted eye.

sitting on a bark thrown, your amber eyes watch for me: a

"I am one of them, and not. 
In a room full of people
	sophisticated, intelligent, capable
I am the odd man, quiet in a corner
Who listens to words 
incomprehensible 
Struggling to piece together a sentence
To match.
Ink bleeds through pages upon
Pages upon
Pages, scratch marks and fat blots of 
Black and blue and red and pink.
As I satisfy myself with one the moment passes
Never to return.

I can feel my participation grade dying.

Invidia hooks her vert nails into me as I stare and wonder
	how the hell can an accounting major
	do my job better than me?
Why I’m not speaking up
Letting my theories and visions breathe.
Instead they wither and suffocate while I smile.
What the hell is the point in thinking
if my thoughts find no release?
Why do I bother
To write and
To read
When I
	clearly cannot match them
never speak my mind?

I confine my analysis to the cage
Of academic essays, literary works
And leave the talk to the professionals while I
Pretend it doesn’t bother me 
When I tell them of my passions.
Ignore their reactions
	Wide eyes and slack jaws, tones of 
	Disbelief dotted with sarcasm and
	Pity
As they force a smile, say
“I’d never take you for an English major!”

Show me the work of Byron
And I will note the beauty
And despair of an affair come to pass
	Though only in my mind.
Share your work with me.
I will fall silent in awe,
Enraptured by the grace of written word
And images that pull tears from my stubborn eyes.
Ask me,
And you will find a feeble fool
Frightened and tense, tongue twisted—
All I want to say dies on my lips
Becomes a tangled jumble of nonsense
as I fear being found out
	what to say of the rhyme or
	rhythm or syntax
	what do they mean
So instead I offer a sheepish grin and say
“That was nice.”
The disappointment in your eyes is matched only
by the pink tinge of my cheeks that screams
	why can’t I get this right?!
Of embarrassment, regret, frustration,
Loathing more bitter than the taste of coffee,
Burnt beans on my twisted tongue.

I am a fraud among my peers.
Lost, scrambling for answers that come
So easily to them
	why not for me?
Too afraid to let them know
to let them feel the tremble of my heart or
the way my thoughts blow
scattered on the wind
Never complete, always fractured, incoherent and
insensible.
Instead I wait in silence with a synthetic smile
and
	when at last it’s over
retreat into the world my mind has made
Encapsulated within the pages
of sticky notes and sketchbooks,
Notepads and journals
Where I am the master
	or at least I think I am?
and where my pen screams louder
than I could ever hope to be. 	",

my mother said you beat your children with rosary beads. 
That’s why none take the Eucharist on their tongues anymore. It is February, 
and each naked tree that rushes past my window reminds me of you,

That’s why you fell, I shivered from the wind
that ran past. I want to say you are watching over me,

through the third when 
I was handed a square, pink package of Manner a month ago in Vienna, 
by a kind blue eyed George

a year younger than me

dustily tuned a quarter-tone sharp,

into the swirls of the River Vltava. 

When I first crossed over the Vltava,
née Moldau, I was searching for a TYME
machine, which is what I call it when I fall
back into old accents. Two girls played the violin
and a couple fled from their wedding
with something old, something new, something sharp,

like my earliest memory: my mother’s voice sharp
in a hotel by the river, not the Vltava
then but the Mississippi. I was at my first wedding
with bows in my hair, blowing bubbles of time
while Pachelbel’s Canon trickled from a violin.
I saw it was elegant and dull to fall

in love, and I couldn’t wait for fall
and Canada geese. I’d watch the sharp
V wing by and think about violets and violins
and, had I known of it then, the Vltava. 
Since that day, I have been saving my time
to deposit in a hope chest for the wedding

I’d rather not have, a wedding
full of family, friends, and people who fall
in between. I check the time
again and it’s seven-thirty sharp
so I have fifteen more minutes on the Vltava,
riding the crests and the rests on my violin.

I have never noticed how my thinnest violin
string glints silver-white like a wedding
band or the sun on the Vltava.
I have a dozen companions to fall
back upon, so I let F-sharp
go and breathe in. Then it is time

to wipe my violin clean and let a bow hair fall,
too yellow for a wedding veil, too sharp
for a cat to eat. The Vltava will call to me another time.",

My watch ticks too fast.
I stand at the top of the stairs
and cry into my teddy bear.

My watch ticks too fast.
Nonno tends to the grill.
I cry into my teddy bear
while Nonna toils over stove.

Nonno tends to the grill
as I stand up in my pajamas.
Nonna toils over the stove
at the bottom of the stairs.

I stand up in my pajamas,
listen to the phone call
at the bottom of the stairs—
Yes, this is she.

I listen to the phone call.
Two whole fish fry, scales and eyes crackling.
Yes, this is she.
Skin sizzles, roasted peppers and eggplant.

Two whole fish fry, scales and eyes crackling.
In my dreams, I tumble toward darkness
and skin sizzles, roasted peppers and eggplant.
Behind me, the lights go out.

In my dreams, I tumble toward darkness,
The couch with leather, peeling skin sits empty
Behind me, the lights go out.
A half-finished game of solitaire sits on the table.

The couch with leather, peeling skin sits empty.
I never hit the ground.
A half-finished game of solitaire sits on the table.
Nonna gasps.

I never hit the ground.
I stand at the top of the stairs.
Nonna gasps.
I fall headlong into darkness.",
