Just as the sounds of the Christmas chime
Are passing away from the earth,
Tremulous still with the truth sublime,
That crowns a midnight to brighten all time
With the light of the wondrous Birth,
I come but a lowly and humble thing,
Will you give me a welcome true?
Over me waves the beautiful wing
Of the Mystery whose Gloria's echoes ring,
In gladness for me and for you.
For sake of the time with mysteries sweet,
For sake of the crib and its Child wilt greet
A coming as humble as mine?
For sake of the Faith that holdeth the pen,
For the glory of God and the true peace of men
In the letters of every line
Wilt welcome the message I bring with me? 
And say to me: "I have a place for thee?
Tell me your story sing me your song,
Come as a friend comes looked-for long,
Out of the din of the world's rude throng,
Where the True is shy and the False is strong
Enter and speak to my very heart
And talk to my mind in the tones of truth
Not in the artful accents of art
But frank with the freshness of gladsome youth.
Wilt welcome me thus as a welcome guest?
Thanks ! STYLUS will come again to you,
To bring to you thoughts if not the Best,
Still something Beautiful, Good, and True.

Oh, fond of old, the warrior bold
To boast a fearless laddie !
To-day, the slight and girlish wight
Is the loved one of his daddy.
My model boy is one whose joy
Is manly, frank and all that;
He may be wild, and a wilful child,
But a boy's a boy for all that.
A laughing lad is not so bad
As many people think him;
He's not a sleek and arrant sneak
Because you can't hoodwink him.
His greatest crime is oftentime
A fault —and mighty small that!
Though free of will, remember still,
A boy's a boy for all that.
He loves the woods in all their moods;
The sea his soul entrances.
With what a greed he loves to read
Old Beadle's dime romances!
Go, preach to him of Seraphim,
Of Cherubim and all that!
'Tis death and din he revels in;
But a boy's a boy for all that.
Do all you can; the little man
Will show his inclinations,
He will be Kane, to plough the main
On Arctic explorations;
He will be Pope, or nurse the hope
Of earning fame, and all that,
It is his way ! Do what you may;
A boy's a boy for all that.
A doctor born, he will not scorn
What doctors deem the fashion,
To murder flies, and analyze
The cats, he makes a passion.
He loves to mix and break and fix,
As chemists do; but all that
Is but the sign of God's design.
The boy's a boy for all that.
His dabbled face and awkward grace,
His hair in wild confusion,
Should not surprise our sober eyes,
Or wake the wild delusion
Of prison, jail, or fiercer tale
Of gallows, death and all that! But make him strong to shun his wrong;
The boy's a boy for all that.
Encouragement! Encouragement!
What need to fret and sadden ?
What were the earth without his mirth?
Urge on the struggling lad then!
Dispel your gloom, and give him room,
And light, and smiles, and all that.
He sometimes should, I own, be good;
But a boy's a boy for all that.

A poet wove a web of golden lines About a fancy of his heart, And said, "'Tis excellent! the muse designs That I be master in my art." From morn till night he toiled, from night till morn And gained the hoped for guerdon, Fame : A guerdon that was half a smile of scorn. And half the shadow of a name. A painter sketched a scene of loveliness, And showed it to a trusty friend, And asked, " What hinders me from that success To which my natural talents tend?" Fie gained the loftiest summit of his hopes Afar heyond his fellow men, But sighed, "Alas! how happy he that gropes Where I should wish to be again !" The boy of Corsica, whose infant hands With warrior toys were early trained, Not idly dreamed of ruling seas and lands. And monarchy by battle gained. Yet ere he long had turned his country's helm, His smiling Destiny had flown, And left him one small island for a realm. A farmer's arm-chair for a throne. An humble saint who in the forest dwelt And shunned the fickle smile of fame. Spoke thus: "Have I not also something felt. That bids me gain a glorious name?" He toiled and prayed, but worried not for praise, And dving deemed his name unknown ; Earth sought it out and shrined it in her lays, And Heaven received him for her own.
The diapason of his life was filled With pregnant harmonies; or ere we thought Its cadence had begun to fall, 'twas stilled In a quick fugue of death, untimely wrought. And all the symphonies of joy are hushed Into th & nocturne monotone of death; Snapped are the twanging chords, and hearts are crushed. As weeps Euterpe for that parted breath. Oh, when we sat below and mused, or knelt In praver and floated up our sighs to God, On the rich flood of harmonies, we felt How great his power: as he touched, or trod, The keys and pedals; sluicing out great streams Of song, that broke.—now thundering, now soft, A great Niagara of notes ! It seems To pitch down still over that organ loft. But no : for broken is the action now Of his heart-instrument of ruddy life: And notes that swelled in unison may flow No more in sonnet-songs with gladness rife. But not for the fair gift alone.—to thrill Responsive hearts, the music angel gave Him, we lament: his taking-off counts still Another loved one, victimed by the grave, For gentle, joyous, generous, all in one: His smile, his hand's warm pressure and his grace. His lips' fond word, with hear'ts full undertone Of love, endeared him.—and his winsome face. Like grace of God so Art the closer clings To finer souls, finds in them kinder soil: And beauty's harvests more abundant brings One touch of inspiration, than the toil Of powers ungifted. through long laboring years. And Art, like grace, in soul endowed like this. Beatifies itself, the while it cheers Less favored mates, with radiated bliss. They lay him dead, his harpsicord beside, On lilies pillowed, that he loved so well; The ebon, ivory keys, whose touch his pride, Like mutes in white and black, best silent tell That the fair fingered hand, stiff-frozen o'er His heart, —is postured till the judgment cornel Through flushing scherzo it shall scur no more : Grief sings adagios round his early tomb. All dead but hope! the stricken felt.—and wept. But that shall never die, they said; and thought His soul could ne'er such mercy hymns have swept Across the chords, to Him who mercy bought For all and to His Mary Mother sweet. Without the saving gift of faith and love : These, for his requiem's hope foundation meet. Must fill the emptied hearts and solace prove. So, mav we meet again: where harp and heart In symphonies of love and song shall playForever : where no breaking chord shall part Our joysome union, in that nightless day. There with the Beauty Increate of God, With all that e'er was lovely, may we stand ; Refined to sainthood, by life's chastening rod, Up,—as he loved to sing,—in -'Edenland!"
Wide bursts the heart of Heaven. And from its very soul, In the midst of a choir of Angels And gilded clouds that roll, The Holy Spirit passes. Soft as the flight of a dove, To the spotless breast of the Virgin blest The gentle Mother of Love. And lo! from a distant valley, Bright gleams of incense rise To greet their onward journey And shade their heavenly eyes From the dreadful sight of evil Flowing on earth below. The direful mark of the demon dark, Man's sworn and deadly foe. And the Angels'joy, unbounded. Bursts forth in strains divine: For the gleam is the bright reflection Of their gentle Queen benign. x\nd they see in that soul of grandeur, God's choicest gifts of love. The holy shrine of His Son divine. Pure as the skies above. And one from the choir of Angels Appears on his golden wings; And. awed by the Virgin's fervor. He bows to the earth and sings : "All hail! to thee, O Mary, For thou art full of grace ! Fear not, I say. for on this day. Thou art pure before God's face. "And thou shalt be the Mother For whom the righteous sigh And thy Son shall be, O Blest One, The Son of the Most High. All hail to thee, O Mary, For thou art full of grace! Fear not. 1 say, for on this day Thou art pure before God's face." And the gladdened Heavens open ; God's voice speaks solemnly : "Thou art all fair, beloved, There is no stain in thee; Thy grace shall check the evil Flowing 011 earth below. The direful mark of the demon dark Shall vanish before thy glow.
The spirits of thy gifted dead Still brood above thy breast, O pond ! The witching Hawthorne, coy Thoreau And Emerson, the poet-seer, Drank deep of thy sweet sorcery. Thy mystic harmonies that lurk In every phase of wood and flood Throb through the cadence of their thoughts. Henceforth, with English Grasmere's wave And far Swiss Leman's fair expanse, A storied, genius-hallowed lake, A sacred, pilgrim-haunted shrine, — 1 hou shalt endure in poesy. Wierd is the scene : I speak with mien And voice of reverential fear. In shifting lines, through phantom pines, Along the many-rippled mere The livid moonlight falls aslant; Around, the minstrel night-winds chant; In broken tones, like crooning crones, On oozy sedge and pebbly sand The waters moan. Lonely and lone I walk the strand.
Reverend Parent of the Common, Loved and honored by his brothers Stood the grand old Elm majestic Towering over all the others. From the biting wind of winter, From the scorching sun in summer With his widely spreading branches He would shelter every comer. 'Neath that welcome shade at noonday Once I lay and gazed in wonder, Where the topmost boughs invading Seemed to seek the realms of thunder, Lost myself in dreamy fancy; And with foolish brain inventive, Listened to the distant rustlings, Listened with an ear attentive, Longed to learn that sylvan language Sweeter than the rippling waters ; Longed to hear the ancient Elm tree Talking to his sons and daughters. What a wealth of old tradition, Tales of war and Indian fighting, Tales of love and peaceful pastime, More than e'er will be in writing, I might know, had he been willing! But his rustling gave no token, And that wealth of old tradition Must for aye remain unspoken ; For 'twas scarce a month thereafter That the thunder crashed so loudly And the jealous lightning smote him, Laid him low who stood so proudly, Laid him low among his children Weeping, groaning in their anguish. They had loved him more than ever Since he had begun to languish. Though his term of life is over And his shade no more refresh us, Yet are relics of his grandeur Honored still and held as precious.
The proudest cities in Judea's land. The fairest that her sons had ever seen. They stood of old; and proudly still might stand, But for the revelry that reigned therein, The presence of a dark and nameless sin That wailed to Heaven, and wailed till Heaven replied, Entombing them in von funeral tide. As still and silent as the dead it hides, That dismal sea no sweeter music knows, Than when the carrion beast, that round it glides, To seek his prey, shrieks out his wild halloes. Vainly upon its breast ihe stormwind blows ; Its depths no crested billows ruffle o'er, Nor ceaseless surges beat upon its shroe. Here is the home of Death. Xor fish is known To revel in its stagnant depths of woe, Nor bird beyond its wastes hath ever flown, And on its banks, no verdant meadows blow, Though fruits there be that fair as Nature grow To view; but as a beauteous gilded crust, To tempt the tongue, within are filled with dust. Yea, all that land, and sea, and all the air Above, eternally shall be accused— Eternally the punishment declare Of those that in its waters lie immersed; For here the laws of Nature were reversed. So shall it ever be when man destroys The bonds of Nature for unholy joys
I held it a thing of mystery That Heaven should smile on thee, when thou, thereat, With knitted brow, didst scoff" and scornful, spat The venom of the vengeful soul in thee. Yet thou wert not, as heathens anciently, " Unconcious of the Majesty that sat On throne ethereal and there begat Thy soul serenely, surely, patiently, And still men hold, as elder spirits dare, That thou incarnate wast of them who fell From heavenly plains, that time the demon king Rebelled against his Lord. So, through the air, Too gross for Heaven, and vet, to light for hell, Thou goest shrieking, moaning, wandering.
Why was earth so gladsome On that memorial night? Why did it lose its harshness And tremble with defight? Why did men's passions leave them For a time in peaceful bliss, And their hearts grow soft as thev gazed aloft From unbelief's abyss? Let us ask those favored shepherds Who watched in the darksome air Outside the sacred Bethlehem Over the pastures fair; I hear their fervent voices, Like notes of love they chime, And they thrill our souls, as the bell that tolls At benediction time. They speak of the glorious vision.— That roused them on that night When they held their midnight vigil, — That bathed the earth in light And gilded the distant heavens, As the Angels sweeping down Entwined with their own bright beings For the earth a living crown. And how, as they hastened downwards, A gem of living fire Shot forth from the crown of spirits Aglow with bright attire : 'Twas an Angel that drew near them. lie bade them not to fear That joy and peace would ever cease, For the Lord of earth was near. But who will tell the gladness That filled the heavenly souls As they bowed before the manger And sang from their burning scrolls? Or who will sing the carols They sang in their joy and mirth When they saw in the Child so meek and mild The King of heaven and earth? And should the earth not tremble And thrill with wild delight? Should her children not be happy To think of that sacred night, When the King of heavenly Sion With all the hosts above Had changed her breast to a heaven blest A home of peace and love?
There are crickets in the garden. And they "cheep,—cheep;" And their wheedling whispers creep, Without even asking pardon, To my listless ear, and coax me (How their monotone provokes me!) Off to sleep. There's a zephyr from the ocean Stealing nigh,—nigh,— Soft as mother's lullaby ; Like some wizard's magic potion, All my sober senses robbing Till mv stupid head keeps bobbing At the sky. Yonder oscillating tree-tops Wierdlv rock an infant Cyclops In the clouds: Babv's eve the moon-light seems, And a drowsy lid its gleams Partly shrouds; And the weary stars are blinking, And I myself am winking, And I fear, —I fear I'm sinking Into dreams.
Ambrose, the saint, as he was named Piously, when men spoke of him. Sat by the door of his hut. in the cool Of a summer eye, when the light was dim. Not idly sat; but plied his craft, No matter how tired his fingers were, With weft of baskets of wicker-work, Since sultry noon and mid-day prayer. For, years agone —three decades and more— He had vowed, in his prime, to the Crucified, To labour and pray, alternately, In the desert, from dawn until eventide. " Surely, the Lord hath witnessed my pledge, Body and soul to Him I owe; And if these hands are now weak," he said, " I must keep them steady until I go." " Surely, the gracious Lord will please To render these failing hands their meed. I lath any one faithfully served Him yet, And found Him not, in hour of need?" Thus, till an hour after fall of sun, Monk Ambrose praved and wrought the while; And when he lifted his head, the light Was faint on the waters of distant Nile. What was it crossed the light, but then? A shape of man, if his eyes told true. " Some brother seeking the city, I trow, Hath erred from the path the wilderness through. " He shall tarry, this happy night, with me. And blest shall I be, if my meal he shares; For. erewhile. in Mambre's Vale, 'tis writ, How Angels were sheltered unawares." Full of his thought, Monk Ambrose sped Forward to meet the stranger guest, And with loving clasp and courteous speech, lie bade him welcome to food and rest. " For. well I know how it fares with him Who travels the sands of the Desert rude; With a comrade more joyous is the feast, And since matins, I have not tasted food. ••But. first I pray you, throw back your hood : The sand blows not thro' my sheltered nook, I have made it pleasant with palm trees' shade And. yonder, runneth the living brook. " God maketh the Desert to bloom for us— And part the shoon from your burning feet, And let me bathe them, on bended knee; To brother and guest such things are meet." Made answer the stranger in gentlest tones; So rapt his look and his smile so rare, That never, thought Ambrose within himself, Had he seen a man so divinely fair. " May lie measure to you an hundred fold The Master, in whom we both confide ! In love and thanks I will sup with you, Though with you, to-night, I may not abide. " For many a league, ere the moon be full Which mounteth now o'er the level plain, I must hie me to join my brethern in choir; But, in brief while, I shall see you again." " God speed you, then, if it must be so; And haste your coming, good youth, to me, For, as never before."my life seems lone; And. lovingly, I shall wait for thee." li Oh. fear me not Father, I shall not stay, Nor fail to bear good tidings to vou : To-morrow morn, at the hour of Prime, Our spirits shall meet in affection true." » Ambrose the Monk looked out on the skies, From his pillow of wood and mat of straw; And he said : " If my sins were not so great, I could believe 'twas the Lord's own self I saw. " For never, at all, among mortal men, Is mien so noble and jovous bright:— Lord, if thy servant find grace with thee, Speak thy message to me. this night." Raphael who standeth before the throne At the word, flashed down from the heights sublime, And said : " Brother Ambrose dost know thy guest? I have come for thee at the hour of Prime.
I -watched a cloud, lone-whelmed in amorous blue, All crimson-edged and silv'ry fair, When, lo! a stealthy sun-shaft pierced it through And glistened down the air. And then, methought the heavenlv deeps did ope, Outpouring through the virgin cleft A mystic sweetness spun with skein of hope On glory's shining weft. And though this cloud has sought the beamless night, No more to bask in sun-glad sky, Its glory and its hope, its shade and light, Still in my bosom lie. I know an isle, by drowsy breezes fanned That gently o'er its mosses creep; The blust'ring surf, eager to lash the strand, There falls in muffled sweep. Erewhile the sun of Friendship strewed his beams Across the island's bounteous heart; — Such sight were worth the bliss of poet's dreams, Or glow of magic art. And though my path thy grots no longer nears, O Isle, thou'rt grown my thought to-day : Not all the breakers on the tide of years Shall chafe thy shores away.
Slow dies the day, as vanquished monarch might, With diademed brow serene in wreathed light. The West is radiant, —all the heavens ablaze With fabled hues that dim the ambient haze Through which the lustrous forest foliage prints Upon the changing scene fantastic tints. With living gold the sunlight's matchless ray Stains the white crests of yonder glimmering bay; And russet meadows flush with jealous shame Till each wan bladelet blossoms into flame. Now ebbs the flood of light with quickening flow, Yon purple summits send a feebler glow, Soft, silent, sad, the sombre night shades fall, And slumber peaceful reigns o'er nature's all.
He knew some fables of the Orient. And once he babbled of a Paradise Wherein all sweets and beauties are vblent That haply might the human heart entice: 1 he which have some by many an apt device " Assayed to reach, and other some by pain Of grievous toil and grim self-sacrifice; But, baffled, soon or late, from ventures vain They shamefaced came unto their olden home again. A traveller's idle tale, —a sheer conceit; Yet from the myth the fair-browed bov had caught Prophetic meaning, and, with Faith replete, His being kindled till it seemed that naught Of clay was his; and in his eyne, methought, Gleamed all the deathless glory of his spright. Such eyne he had—translucent skies and fraught With all the witchery of the jewelled night, And all the glad effulgence of the noon's large light. Nor yet I dreamt his gaze would eftsoons shine In spirit worlds. And as one loves the bland, Green freshness of the Spring,—the ceaseless brine, And every marvel from God's wondrous hand. So loved we him ; but selfish we, though lorn, For he has won his way to Edenland And quaffed the sunlight of an endless morn. And shall we grieve that he has gained that blissful bourne?
To heavenly melody attuned, the lyre Of old philosophies God gave to man ; Man snapped the golden strings in wanton mirth, And patched the fabric with a rotten wire, No more, to touch responsive, chords of fire From swift vibration gave to music birth; But as the years grew great, grew less its worth, Till man, despairing, cast it in the mire.
One stoops to touch this vilest of all things; A lowly monk, to earthly honors blind, Bv God's good aid, restores the golden strings, Discoursing sweetest music to the mind, Till all the breadth of earth and heaven rings With praise of him, the genius of mankind.
A wearied hermit, once at close of day, Beside his cell in meditation lay; And much he pondered, being sore distressed, “For man," thought he, “is little at his best, And God, if merciful, is surely just. Alas! poor creatures, formed from out the dust, From day to day heap sin on sin, and still He gives us strength to do His Holy will.” While thus he wondered, sudden from his sight Was gone the arid plain; instead, a light As ne'er again his mortal eyes might see; 'Twas Heaven and God's enthroned majesty. On Him he durst not look, but standing there Before the throne with proud, defiant air Was he who wrought our ruin and disgrace, Fury and hate in his averted face. “Lo! Men may forfeit heaven a thousand times, And pardon granted, they renew their crimes; I sinned but once; what pardon is for me? An agony that ne'er shall ended be!” And calmly spake a voice in answer sweet, Which made the lowly monk's heart warmly beat, And Lucifer e'en heard with lowered head “And did'st thou ever ask me once It said. The vision passed; the hermit looked in vain. Before him lay the wide, outstretching plain. Full long he lingered thus as one amazed; And then his eyes with joy to heaven he raised; “Oh ! God, I thank Thee for Thy grace so great, Not miserable, happy is our state. Tho' countless as the sands our sins may be, Thy mercy, Lord, is boundless as the sea.”
Charged is thy soul with bitter thoughts, of late, Thy passions use a sword of keenest power; Shaft all that once was ours no hope create That love again will blossom into flower? Is then thy love recast in mould of hate, That it disdains remembrance of the hour When in thy heart's embrace, at heaven's gate, . " I seemed to sing, though darkness there might lower? nought persuade thee? dost no pleasure feel As Memory with golden chain thy mind Leads back to happy youth and hours of ease ? Thou art not touched! then be thy breast of steel, Thy Honor's eve to every sense of duty blind, -And bold thy soul to scorn God's dread decrees! 
Aurora's first bright rosy ray, Foynd Thetis on the Olympian way; While morning mists o'er ocean rise, Before Appolo's beams she flies. Her silver slipper half reveals The goddess whom the cloud conceals. So, lightly o'er the white capped waves She heavenward mounts and Juno braves. Straightway to Jove's bright throne she speeds, And for her dear Achilles pleads. Who may resist bright eyes' appeals When such'as she in suppliance kneels? Her prayer is heard. Assents the God. Heaven trembles at its monarch's nod.
Like children we grow sated of our toys And fling them from us. The huge littleness Of gorged ambition, all the puny joys Of power and the paltry, spiritless Command of wealth—these guerdons of success Will seem unto us yet more poor and weak Than does, to-night, the doubt that would depress, Or student rivalry, or madcap freak, Or college concpioat o'er some intricate old Greek. And yet 'tis something to have lived; for life ' Is not a dream within a dream, And there is motive in our earthly strife. The lilac blossoms, and the orchards teem; The minstrel-elms enchant, the sun-kissed stream Makes music as it leaps from stone to stone. In ministering to man Earth finds her constant theme. And thus Earth's regent in his turn is prone To seek true happiness in godliness alone. Oh ! what a grisly farce this life ! And we, What puppet players of a pantomime, Were conscience habit, our expectancy A mocking shadow, creeds but lies; if time Ne'er merged into eternity, and crjmeL. . V. /- " Were synonyme with virtue. We arc blest A That noble deeds can prime. And a pure conscience lend to life a zest And cheer us with a pledge of sempiternal rest.
And what is conscience? 'Tis the echoed voice Of God within us, whence the spirit learns To flee fronvevif and in good rejoice; A compass of the heart that ever turns To where the pole-star, virtue, brightly burns. A sapphire skv, the soul's pure canopy, Whiles blear with mist, whiles flecked with cloud that spurns The fair expanse ; a glass wherein we see Reflected phases of the soul's morality. Uniquely favored we, for whom, brought forth Qf woman, dieda Christ. And yet, ' Beneath the torpid twilight of the North, Or where the Amazon, in trb'pic state, Barbaric argosies with odorous freight Rolls seaward, millions of a savage race Are sharers in this gift, though still they wait The teachings of the Word to which we trace The dawning Of a better, fuller light of grace. Aye, from that gray, primeval Eden-day When first our wondering grandsire felt the flush Of life, and knew his manhood from thq clay, An angel guide, whom oft we seek to crush, Dwells ever in our hearts.; and when we blush In penitence, consoles, and when, forlorn, In desert wilds we thirst and fain would rush In quest of phantom waters', hastes to warn Lest we should loose the path unto our heavenly bourne. And when, as heathens break a god of stone Or brazen image, man denies the Power That gave him being, and assails the throne And foot-stool of his Maker, —in that hour, Though deaf to Virtue's promptings, .mark him cower Beneath the scourge of conscience. Round him hiss The fabled Furies. Hideous demons lower; j And, while they taunt him with his loss of bliss, Despair unlocks the portals of her black abyss. But conscience wears a winsome, holier mien When, chiding not, her task is to commend. There is'no human happiness so keen ) As bis wboscguileless life does not oflend The law of right. An inner peace will tend To make the sense of being ecstasy ; - - , While color, form and sound sublimely blend Hp universal music vast and free, And his soul.ecboes to the cosmic symphony. Ah ! God, for men like great ones long gone. Or like the blameless knight of crdss and glaive Whose conscience was hisvking! And such aoMp * We knew, my comrades, one who freely gave hislife to science; not as. they who brave The ice-docked Pole or torrid wastes in pride To win a glory he would scorn to crave. He lived a martyr from disease, nor sighed For aught, and spoke no word and gave no sign, but died.
Defeat was there sublimer than success. Son of Loyola, who didst patient moil To teach us lore men but in part possess ' Of Nature, thou hast learnt withouten toil The guarded secrets th;lt are wont to foil. We linger groping blindly in the night; . And round our awed and saddened hearts there coil The tendrils,of thy memory. But. dight In immortality, thou walk'st with God in light. ENVOY. Let us so live, my mates, that when the call Of Death's grim angel comes, the insatiate grave Shall spare our characters. Whate'er befall, Let it be said: '*Yon man to duty clave. A foe to sin, to conscience he was slave."
From the glowing halls of heaven, An eternal breath was sent To live in a mortal dwelling, Till the portals should be rent Bv the spear of Death's dark angel; What time she might take wing, If free from alloy, To unending joy, Or if tainted, to suffering. Ah! weary the days of exile, And darksome the many powers That tempted the Soul in her dwelling, Through the long and lonely hours! And within was a foe clandestine Made her often tremble and thrill, Who to save or to slay Held unlimited sway, And his name, the tyrant, Will. The flood of the world forever Flowed by the bolted door, And its ravishing ripples were lifted Till the music that they bore Awakened the inmost chambers; Yet the Soul ne'er joined in the mirth : For her only love Was in Heav'n above And not upon the earth.
I. (From the German of SALIS.) The grave is dark and cold and lone; Grim, ghastly horrors 'round it fall. It stretches like a sombre pall Betwixt us and the land unknown. The nightingale's sweet, mellow lay May ne'er its frigid bosom cheer; And friendship's roses wither here, Their leaves on mossy knolls decay. And yet, —tho' man may elsewhere roam, Here, here alone is the longed-for rest. Through Death's dark portals, God's behest Bids welcome to the brighter home. And here at last, poor Heart, thy life From hurtling storms shall find release; Through sorrow shalt thou reach the peace, Where cares are o'er, and hushed is strife. II. (From the French of MARIE.) When we and Time are gay and young, As swiftly pass the days As boiling torrents, headlong flung Down mountains' rock}' ways. For Time a living fountain is, Whose source cannot be dried. Yet come the heat, and then, I wis, Is stemmed the torrent's tide. Then like a miser, man is seen Bent o'er his tardy days ; Or one who, from a mirror's sheen, Doth seek reflected rays. But vain his task; the autumn leaves, In falling, fleck the streams : Obscured is all the eye perceives, And faint the sunlight gleams.
The golden lamps of heaven hung bright In Judah's midnight sky, Like rays of glory darting through The sapphire home on high ; While down the azure avenues Was borne, in strain sublime, The clustered angel's joyous hymn. The first glad Christmas chime. "To God be glory! peace to men!" The radiant seraphs sang, "Illume a world in darkness hurled!" The starry cymbals rang. "The Babe divine whose love shall shine Through every age and clime, For man is born this glorious morn," So pealed that Christmas chime. Though centuries have flown since first That anthem grand was sung — Each passing year its welcome notes In Christmas homes have rung. And ransomed lands their chainless hands Uplift in every clime To Freedom's God, and hail with joy The pealing Christmas chime. I O blessed bells ! bring cheer to all, The sad, the poor, the lone, Who shivering crouch by cheerless hearths, Or bowed in anguish moan; Make human hearts, with gen'rous deeds, Enrich this festal time, That even Want and Woe may smile To hear the Christmas chime.
Spring hath her violets bright, peeping from the mosses, Summer hath her sunshine, Autumn her light and shade, While every haunt is vocal, With a paean local, Keeping time to the chime Of jubilant cascade. Winter hath his deep repose —his pleasure ever dawning, His granaries and garners of Autumn's luscious fruit; There be phantom shadows Flitting o'er the meadows, — Sighs the sedge by the edge Of the brooklet mute. Even though the noisy barn the swallow hath deserted, Going ere gay Autumn kissed the maple leaves, Every snow-flake airy, Coming like a fairy, Taketh rest in her nest, 'Neath the jutting eaves. What though the winter sky is darkened by the tfempest, Veiling in the sunbeam with its chilling shroud, There be merry faces Where the hearth-fire blazes ; By the board amply stored, Gentle beings crowd. Spring hath her velvet robes, and Summer hath her rubies Autumn hath her riches in every ripened ear But Winter hath his glory, Like Wisdom waxing hoary, Holding reign on hill and plain, Bold monarch of the year.
Good night, myself, and balmy sleep, Close up these eyes with poppy flowers, And cast thy spell around me deep. O angels, who in stilly hours, Drop dew of dreams from dewy wings, Bring back again some dead old day, Some golden hour to which I cling, O angels, let it live alway.
In memory oft one sees Joys of a long-gone day : 'Tis the fruit of autumn's trees, ‘Tis the echo on the breeze When the song hath died away.
The pulse ofearth beat fast and strong: It was the time when she upsprings From chilly slumber, and, on wings Bright green and golden borne along, Spring holds her course across the gloom Of wintry fields, and in her wake A thousand flowers from dull clods break To sparkle into brilliant bloom. The purple gems were on the trees, I strolled alone, and in a wood, A silent, lonely place, I stood And caught a melody of glees, Struggling to fill the dark and rise To heaven—the sweet song died away Without an answer. Ah ! that lay, Unanswered thus 'neath Northern skies, If sung in Southern groves had filled And lit the darkest deep with songs, And echo music from the throngs Of warblers there had joyous thrilled. Mv heart was chill, tho' all above The bright sun shone. Poor stranger bird .' He sang and sang but never heard From his old mate a note of love; For she, the charming little one, That sangwith him the dead last year, No more would warm to life and rear His nestlings in the summer sun. In Death's cold vaults no flowers may bloom, Nor Spring may wake the sleeping dead, Nor sun may warm their chilly bed, For aye, 'tis Winter in the tomb. 
There was many a beauteous form, Mother, With blooming health full bright; And virgin fair with rippling hair Like streams of golden light: But none so fair as thou, Mother, In all the world, they say, For thou art Queen of the May, Mother. Thou art Queen of the May. There's not a flower that blooms, Mother. As pure and fair as thou: And every hand in every land Pays homage to thee now. And on thy shrine we'll place, Mother, Sweet buds and garlands gay; For thou art Queen of the May, Mother, Thou art Queen of the May. And this is the fairest month, Mother, The fairest month of all; On every side, both far and wide, Thy children to thee call: With loving hearts and pure, Mother. They kneel to thee and pray: For thou art Queen of the May, Mother, Thou art Queen of the May. Oh ! cleanse our hearts from sin, Mother. From sin and sorrow free, And pure as snow make us below: This gift we beg of thee. Direct our feet aright. Mother, Upon the heavenward way, For thou art Queen of the May, Mother, Thou art Queen of the May.
For we are all thy slaves. Mother, Thy slaves, nor would we be For love, nor gold, nor wealth untold. From this sweet bondage free. So from our duty's path. Mother. Oh ! never let us stray, For thou art Queen of the May, Mother, Thou art Queen of the May.
Farewell, my faithful steed, farewell! My parting grief no tongue may tell, For thou hast served me—ah ! so well, My pony'. Not Pegasus, in days of yore, With lighter foot his master bore, Than thou hast me 'long Latium's shore, My pony. How oft, in hours of direst need, With help from thee, my ready steed, I'd dart through Greece with wondrous speed, My pony'. But now we part, my gallant one. Our classic course is almost done; The last bold race is almost run, My pony!
Why must we love, when our dreams of bliss Fade all so soon away? Why must we love in a realm like this Of darkness and decay ? Why was the beautiful born to dwell Deep in our hearts with a mystic spell, Bidding us worship it long and well, The idol of a day.? Why must we love in this changeful sphere, Where gleams of summer light Vanishing leave but a cloud, a tear— Shadows where all was bright? Why do we cherish each thrilling tone, Gushes of melody, swiftly flown, Leaving us sadly to weep alone, Alone in the voiceless night? Why must we toil with a viewless chain, Weaving its weight of woe, Linking bright smiles with a fearful pain Racking the heart below? Why must the spirit in secret pine, Laying its all on*the same dear shrine, Frail things that seem almost divine, Why must we love them so? Why must we love, when the yawning tomb Ever may claim its prize, Hiding away in its depths of gloom Laughter of sunny eyes, Robbing the cheek of its crimson glow, Sealing the lips' melodious flow? Why must we love them when Ah ! we know All that is lovely dies? Why must we love? Let the angels tell; They who have watched our strife, Glad when their clients had trodden so well The paths with danger rife. Love hath a mission of mercy here, Lifting the soul to its native sphere! There where full joy conquers earthly fear Love hath an endless life.
I stood beside the flower-decked graves of those Whose noble souls had long since passed away, And war-scarred men and heroes, too, were there, The living with the dead, who erst had stood Together on the smoky battlefield, Each breast a target for the bolts of war— They are immortal now. We mourn to-day, But Grief is crowned with immortelles that sprang From heroes' blood, our grief is full of joy, And not the hopeless feelings of Despair. 'Tis meet a nation's tears should freely flow, O nameless dead ! we greet you all and come In solemn silence round your tombs to give The simple homage that the future years Will better pay and men unborn will give More gladly, fondly than our hearts can feel. 'Tis fitting wheresoe'er our Stars and Stripes Are floating, there our flag should droop its folds. O nameless dead! upon your country's heart Your names and deeds are written, and they ne'er Shall fade from out that book. Forever there, As long as Freedom's sun shall proudly play Round Liberty's broad dome so high in air, And till its walls are crumbled into clay, Your names shall live, nor in its ruin die. 0 ye who lean upon a hollow reed, And find in mirth and gayety your joy, Go to the place of tombs and learn how vain Ambitious dreams and earthly honors are. Thoughtless I strolled among the ranks of dead; A solemn lesson, ere I turned away, Was treasured in my heart—The pride of earth, Its honors, toils and gains—Earth's treasures all As nothing seemed to heaven's approving smile, With soul attuned to gratitude and praise, 1 turned from that lone burial place, and forth, With chastened spirit and a grateful heart, I went to mingle with the world again.
The robin sings on the spray, And the cricket sings on the hearth, And the zephyr sings as it sweeps away, O'er the beautiful laughing earth. The swallow sings from the eaves, Where her downy nestlings listen, And a concert thrills the lilac leaves Where silver and pearl wings glisten. The rill, with a merry chime, Responds to the wind-swayed tree, And the eagle's fierce free song keeps time With the voice of the deep-toned sea. The notes of song have rang From palace to cottage lowly, Since the morning stars together sang For joy, with the angels holy. The babe in the cradle sings In tune with the mother's heart— And the convict sings to deaden the stings Of memory's remorseful dart. At eve, the maiden's song Entrances the spell-bound lover, And music softens the labor-gong The toiling wide world over. The tones of pride and power Peal loud from the conqueror's tongue; And the sailor cheers the midnight hour Withthe hymn his mother sung. The lays of his native shore From the exiles lips are ringing, And the Christian singeth evermore; And the poet's life is singing.
Whence flow the poet's dulcet numbers ? Whence rise his thoughts of magic song? Whv flit o'er his spirit's vision Sweet scenes that never cheer the throng? Go ask the fountain purling, gurgling. Why gushes forth its sunny stream : Go ask the child when clothed in slumber, Why angels sketched its fairy dream : The poet's soul is formed for music And he but echoes forth the notes That rise within, as swell the harpstrings When gentle Zephyr o'er them floats. His measured rhyme and pleasing accents Are but the ripples in the flow OfFancy's clear and pearly river, That bathes the soul in sunny glow. If longer, deeper thou wouldst question Whence comes the poet's pleasing sway, I'd point to Him, whose love and goodness Sent song to cheer man's lonely way.
Time was when all the vast creation moved In harmony with God's unspoken law, Leading its spheres along the paths ungrooved Of space—a silent pageant; yet a flaw Marred all the mighty concord, till earth saw In man—the acme of creative art— What filled the gaping void, the human heart. Go where thou wilt; from Afric's torrid hills To Artie seas unruffled by the keel Of venturous commerce, and wherever thrills The life of man, there lives a heart to feel Those arguments prophetic that reveal A deep desire —inborn —a hope sublime That soars above the bounds of space and time. For what are space and time that they should so Contract the vision of infinity That lives within the intellect as but to show, Our yearning eyes, what only seems to be, And seeming dies away, as when at sea The lightning flash upon the sailor's sight One moment gleams, and vanishes in night. We are but children, in the quest of peace, That grasp at nothings, deeming love and life And wealth and pleasure, joys that never cease, Till when the dark dread hour of mortal strife Shall close in death, and keenly as a knife, The light of truer knowledge enters deep And shows how vain what we deemed worth to keep. Like moths we flutter idly round a flame, Bewildered, and the gaudy glare of earth, A brilliance that we falsely deem the same As that fair light of all transcending worth Which first shone glorious on creation's birth, Lures us to perish in a candle's ray When but an hour had brought the light of day. One lives to follow science in her quest Among the buried years, and roams the caves And halls of hidden learning with a zest That drinks its fill of lore, and yearning craves For still another draught, until he raves Delirious, and boldlj r dares proclaim That science is his god, and God —a name. But, though for years to come, aye myriads more, Should science fill her measure to the brim, From out the sea of yet unwritten lore, And chant unceasing her exultant hymn ; There yet shall be an end ; her light grow dim, Unless, illumed by Faith, her magic rod Points out the path that leads the soul to God. For what is Science but to know the ways Of Nature and her manifold designs, As maps, or charts, —as keys whereon she plays Her wondrous song? But to the heart that pines For wisdom, science speaks in mystic signs, Like stars that glimmer brightly through the gloom, And point to lands that lie beyond the tomb. Think not he walks in peace who fails in this, And spurns the silent promptings of the heart, As relics of the child, or dreams of bliss Unworthy of the soul, his nobler part; For there are stings that make the conscience smart In hours of lonely thought, when full of care, The heart, bereft of God, sinks in despair. What use to live, if, when this life is done, The very purpose of our life we miss ? What use to plod in fruitless doubting on, A prey to Sin and Sorrow, if for this, Instead of Nature's promise, endless bliss, We shall receive no guerdon but the grave? What use for this dark end to toil and slave? Was it for this our eyes looked out on life At life's first dawning, weeping for our woe? Was it for this we mixed in mortal strife From youth to manhood, dealing blow on blow To save life's little remnant, though we know The petty woes that fret the present hour Shall day by day increase their baneful power? To him who in the silence of his heart Holds converse with the voice that murmureth Of God, a peace supernal reigns,, a part Of that sweet peace that follows after death ; And in his prayers an incense like the breath Of angels rises, and he sees from far, Through the dim mists of faith, God's guiding star. For him life has a purpose and result Above the paltry likings of the sense, Who builds about his heart, against the cult And cant of social heartlessness, a fence Of fire, and guards it with a love intense And steady purpose onward still to plod Along the path that leads the soul to God.
The Summer's golden days are past. And all its blooming tints are fled. With Autumn's frost, how sadly fast The withering Blight has come instead ! Rudely, the chilling blasts sweep by. And call aloud. O man ! to thee.— Go read upon the brown leaves nigh Thy quick approaching destiny. As fairest blossoms withered lie. Sweet, simple tokens of decay, So time's rude frost will dim thine eye. And thou too, soon, wilt pass away." Bright Autumn leaves. I gaze on ye, And visions sweet my bosom swell; Ye make no saddened thought for me. Though mine own fate ye seem to tellWhen last I gazed, all burnished green The summer woods were waving fair ; — And now I see the sombre screen That only Autumn forests bear. Ah ! ye are fading not more fast Than he who loves sweet Autumn's gloom ; His moments here will soon be past. Until with you he finds a tomb. 'Twere sweet to die 'mid Autumn hours. When mourning forests sadly wave; Fitter are withered leaves than flowers, To strew upon an early grave.
Should you ask me why this dunning, Why all these complaints and murmurs, Murmurs loud about delinquents. Who have read the paper monthly. Read what they have never paid for. Essays from the stately Sophist. Burning speeches from the Rhetor. All the phantasies and phospor— Essence of the poet's corner. All the combined wit and wisdom Fact and fancy of the Domi. From the printer, from the mailer. From the kind old paper maker. From the man who taxes letters, With the stamp of L'ncle Samuel — Uncle Sam the rowdies call him— From them all there comes a message Sweet but ominously spoken : Please to pay the bill you owe me." Sad it is to hear the message. When our funds are all exhausted, When the last greenback has left us. When the nickles all have vanished, Gone to pay the toiling printer. Gone to pay the paper-maker. Gone to pay old Uncle Samuel. Uncle Sam who always charges. Sad it is to turn our ledger, Turn the leaves of this old ledger. Turn and see what sums are due us. Due for volumes long since ended. Due for years of pleasant reading, Due for years of anxious labor, Due despite of constant dunning, Due in sums from one to twenty. Would you lift a burden from us? Would you drive a spectre from us? Would you taste a pleasant slumber? Would you have a quiet conscience? Would you read a paper paid for? Send us money ! Be it silver Be it paper, send it early. Send the money that you owe us.
When the brow of the morning is misty and gray. Then silently Winter steals over the lawn ; He dares not to come in the broad open day. But waits till the curtains of twilight are drawn. Far over the meadow he'll noiselessly pass, For soft as the wool are his sandals of frost. The heart of the maple grows cold at his face. The flowers are dead where his footsteps have crossed. Along the green pathway and over the brow Of the hill, and out by the woodland he'll pass. To snatch the red leaves from the sycamore's bough And fetter the fountain that freshened the grass. He laughs at the numb viny fingers enclose From the branch where the bitter-sweet nestled for weeks. And crossing the orchard he chills as he goes The mellowing apples and blanches their cheeks. The robins all start as he ventures anear, And much do they tremble with terror and chill; And far shall they flee from the stranger thev fear. To the groves where the summer is lingering still. But still in the darkness when Autumn's asleep. The pitiless Winter goes hastening on O'er meadowy moorland and mountainous steep. Where'er the bright season before him have gone.
From out oblivion's rubbish heap. The dusty hand of memory brings The gathered waste of mortal things. Mouldering in decaying sleep. A feather of some childish pride; A ringlet of some laughing glee. A laurel-leaf of rivalry, A shroud which wound a hope that died. And linking hand in hand with mine. She leads me through the narrowing way, Backward toward my natal dav, Undoing all the work of time. Till Being's landmarks fail my sight; And losing all I've gained from earth, I seem to ebb from out my birth. And lapse again in primal night.
The cold wind whistles around the shop. It whistles around the window-pane, It whistles across the chimney-top, But the cobbler whistles a merrier strain, While upper and sole go flippity-flop, And winds gb whistling round the shop. Mv rich old neighbor is troubled in mind, Lest his riches may suddenly put on wings, Lest his houses may burn in the night, when the wind Is high—but the cobbler laughs and sings, And whistles and works with a flippity-flop, While night-winds whistle around the shop. O ve who shiver and shake out-doors, Whose beards are frosty, but not with age, Think of him who sits where the stove-pipe roars, And laughs at the storm-king's impotent rage; While leather and last go flippity-flop, And winds go whistling round the shop. At home, there's need of a hood, a frock, A book, a slate, or a nice new doll For the youngest and brightest of all the flock, There are four or five of the flock in all; For whom the leather goes flippity-flop, While winds go whistling round the shop. And in that home a slice may be found For the stranger poor who happens along, "While winter winds are drifted round And while the cobbler is willing and strong, To make the hammer go flippity-flop, And cold winds whistle around the shop. O ye who fancy your joys are few, And ye who always repine at your lot. Just call and see a philosopher true, And learn to be glad for the good you've got: And see the leather go flippity-flop And hear the whistling round the shop.
Will they not come? Will merry Christmas bring No festive gathering, The priceless charities of hearth and home? The star-lit sky, how clear ! The air seems filled with tears, 'tis cold— Methinks it was not so of old. Trim, trim the fire, Tune harp and lyre; Be manful. O my soul, restrain the tear. Our old hearth-stone! Ah ! there are tear-drops there. And furrowed brows of care, And cups of bitterness. The shadowy one, Coming with stealthy tread, Has from his ebon wings in wrath, Shed wasting mildew on our path, And offers me In sympathy, The hearth stone memories only of the dead. Are they all here? Eight olive-plants had grown Around my old hearth-stone. Tike blossoms in the sunlight. Year by year As seeming ripeness came, God sent in love the reaper forth To take His harvest from the earth. Are they not here? Forgive the tear, Thev're here: mv heart embalms them in God's name. Ave, all are here : Seven are as jewels set In Heaven's own coronet, Teachers of holiness, afar, yet here. Ah ! one and one alone, Remains to count the vacant seats, Whiie hallowed memory repeats The joyous lays Of other days That glad hearts chatted round the old hearth-stone. Ave, all are here; Come let us gather round Our long-lost children crowned With spirit-gems unwrought. Aye, all are here, Come dearest, let us call The loved ones of our household, where We oft with them have offered prayer, And always praise To Him. whose ways Are fathomless, vet merciful to all. Dust, ashes, earth ; These are the relics strewn Around the old hearthstone. Sole tokens left of their endearing birth. And breathes the heart a sigh? 'Tis holy; let it rise, remain; Though tears may fall like summer rain, We lift our eyes To brighter skies, To God's own Christmas gathering house on high.
The New Year's Eve! the chill winds whistle shrill. And mournful flaps the lattice in the night, The snowfall mantles over dale and hill. And eddying snowdrifts blind thewildered sight. And all is still, save where in lighted halls, In snatches heard, being broken on the storm. The revel rings, and distant music falls, To which a hundred feet and hearts beat warm. The New Year's Eve! a night of love and glee. To those young hearts I fondly call my friends, But dear and lone this New Year's Eve to me, And pensively my mind to sadness tends. There is no eye that sorrow hath not wet; No breast that for a loved one doth not mourn, There is no joy untainted of regret, And griefs the portion of all woman-born. Ah me! the smiles, the tears there are to-night, Such is the sad variety of life, Here merry laughter peals in halls of light, There the lorn husband mourns his dying wife. Perchance in some low room withouta fire, Without a light perhaps or drink or crust. The starving mother sees her babe expire. And hears her children's cries above the gust. Oh ! who when haggard Misery doth weep Would add a grief to make her weep the more? What cruel breast would doom to endless sleep, The breaking heart sweet kindness might restore? How many a heart last New Year's Eve was gav, Within the churchyard now lies cold and still! How many a heart will sleep beneath the clay, A short year hence that now doth gayly thrill! How many a voice that charms to-night in song, All hushed and still next New Years Eve maybe! How many a face will vanish from the throng. How many an eve will lose the light of glee ! No more for them the summer sunlights play, Nor roses bloom, nor cuckoos sing their loves; The mellow beams but fall upon their clay, Their ears are deaf unto the song of doves. In vain the mother mourns her darling boy, And cries all day and weeps the night away; But ah, ne'er more he comes to make her joy; She never more will watch his infant play. In vain his picture, from its sacred place, Looked down upon the sorrowing upturned brow, Those eyes are fixed and marble is the face, Nor lips now smile and eyes not sparkle now. Ah ! then, when death has ta'en the loved away, How hallowed sweet becomes each little toy, How sacred now each instrument of play : The top and wheel that once amused our boy! The flowers that die and fade away, The summer sun as lovely will restore; But ah, no more those forms that melt to clav, Shall wake to sun or summer—ah, no more! And all must die;—alike the high and low; Here Wealth and Knowledge, Power and Art prove vain; The scythe of Death impartially doth mow, And king and kerne are cut like so much grain. The lords of earth, the fates that ruled their day, Great Alexander and Timour are gone : A narrow mound now holds the giant clay Of him who sighed there was no earth but one. Alas, for fame, to which vain minds aspire! Alas, for pomp and titles; —-maiden s myrrh. An honest name's an honored title higher Than mightiest of monarchs can confer. And who, alas! of all the wise and high, Can bid the summer's parting sun delay? And when the birds and lovely flow'rets die, What wisdom can prolong their little day? The halls of Pride,—the far-famed Babylon, The tower Presumption reared on Shinar's plain, O'erthrown in dust, their pride, their glory gone, Now nought but fragments'of what were remain. No more in Xinive the feast prolongs; Saracus fell, and with him Assyr's sway, No more in Rome the Coliseum throngs To ring applause, and urge the'inhuman fray. But hark ! the city bells peal loud and clear, And mournful toll the old year's funeral knell, And yon poor, haggard outcast stops to hear, And would they too were his sad passing bell. And as before the rich one's house he stands, Where music, light and laughter speed the hour. His winged thoughts fly far to other lands : He thinks of home, the sweet parental bower, And now the tear comes o'er that sunken eye, That once shone brightly to a mother's praise, As then he pictures home, and native sky, And Winter's moon for him sheds Summer's rays. The low white cottage, gleaming throngh the trees, The mead, the barnyard, and the distant hill; The baying watch-dog, heard upon the breeze, The peacock proud, and chanticleer all shrill. And where the roads were crossed the village school With murm'ring learners vex his aching sight; The master, spectacled, with book and rule, And lowering brow all idlers to affright. Yes, that sweet life we live in other breasts, This outcast knew and tremulously felt: The twilight walks, the long and frequent rests, The panting heart, for sweetness that would melt. 'Twas his to sit beneath the linden tree In tender converse by his Mary's side; 'Twas his, when bright Hyperion doth flee, Upon the lake with her he loved to glide. But now. another picture starts his sight, A sad procession wending its slow way, To yonder kirk, where many a mournful night, The tearful lover knelt alone to pray. Alas there is no gold without alloy. There is no beauty without decay, Alas ! alas ! there is no mortal joy, That hath not tang of sorrows native clay ! But see, he's gone, his story yet untold. His romance sad. the wanderer forgot, Here Pride condemmed, and Charity was cold, Unpitying Wealth disdained to change his lot. But it is late—the fire less bright doth shine; The candle swales, and fainter beams its light: The circling dial marks the flight of time, And New Year's dawn springs from the Old Year's night.
The rhyme of the heart though ever unsung, Is sweeter by far than the song of the tongue; And the rose-bud that died on the breast of June Seemed sweeter because it died so soon; And the sweetest notes of the singing bird Are the half caught strains from a distance heard, So weird and low they come from afar, As if heaven's gates were left ajar. Perhaps this may answer the reason why Those thoughts are dearest which deepest lie; For the balm that soothes the soul's unrest Is the song of the heart that is ne'er expressed. Like a miser that gloats o'er his secret store, In the silence of midnight, we love to pour O'er memory's treasures that shun vulgar sight, And hide in our hearts for our soul's delight. There are names that sound as angels' tread, And echoes of voices long since fled. Dear faces we see through the dark clouds of years, Whose smiles greet our sight like a rainbow of tears, There are hand clasps and greetings we ne'er shall forget, Though the hand may be dust, and those fond eyes be set; And hearts that quickened with love's kindly token, Are stilled in death or in life are now broken. Though hopes have died like that still-born rose, Yet their early fragrance scents life to its close. All, all are sweet symphonies ne'er expressed, The priceless treasures of every breast; And the only sign the world may seek Is a flash of the eye or a glow of the cheek. For the ills of to-day fond Memory supplies These airy fancies from Paradise.
The day to me is dead! Nor in the West Is settled for repose its glorious head; No morning's call will wake it from its bed, As one might greet an over-sleeping guest. The day to me is dead! but ah ! the night, The ever-speechless night is deader far; I cannot read the language of the star, Each evening burning with a new delight. I waken then, and think my sight restored, And to the-casement make my creeping way; But from th' eternal censers comes no ray Upon my darkened sense with healing poured. The day to me is dead ! Ere I arise, I hear the stifled bustle of the morn, As when a long-expected babe is born — But share not in the general, glad surprise. The day to me is dead! My house within, The choicest, most delightful sense is gone ; The smile, the tear, the look I doted on I cannot now detect, though I may win. The day to me is dead! The little hand I cannot see, thrust helpful into mine; Nor can I view the pitying look divine By which my blank and darkened face is scanned. Compassionate, my children gather round, While I sit back amid this fell eclipse; Their mother has some solace on her lips, Which dies within her ere it be a sound. I wonder if they ever doubt my love ! For now I cannot speak it in a glance! I know it must their secret woe enhance To view these vacant sockets set above. The day to me is dead! I kneel in prayer, But need not now my outer eye to close; My soul hath always a constrained repose, For from its chambers none is gazing there. Darkness alone around, I breathe and feel; All sounds come from its cavernous abyss; And light would seem a blessedness, a bliss Too sweet for aught, but Heaven to reveal. I waver now 'twixt faith and dark despair, I cannot think this stroke some accident, A random shaft that came to me half-spent, And quivering here for want of God's great care. Thou, God, art near the helpless and the blind? Is this Thy shadow resting on my soul? Then panting forward to Life's welcome goal, I will not deem thy providence unkind. The day to me is dead! I ne'er shall see On earth an emblem human or divine; But when my Father's glories on me shine, His smile my new eternal day shall be!
Thou art, oh Lord, the light Of all that's sweet and fair; In Thee, all things are bright— Thy glance, Thy smile is there. The stars, that burn above, The flowers, that blush below, Bear witness to Thy love, Thy power and wisdom show. From world to world afar, Extends Thy sov'reignty; Thou guid'st the rolling star, And 'walk'st the raging sea; When Polar winds are high, Thy spirit's in the storm ; Yet 'neath a gentler sky, Thy breath, how soft and warm ! High o'er the mountain's height, Towers Thy majestic form ; And smileth in the light, And frowneth in the storm ; Adoring Nature burns, Thy vestal lights on high ; The planet as it turns, Chants Thy divinity. The earth, the sky, the main, All things are filled with Thee: All, all, Thou dost contain In Thy immensity. When worlds be wrapt in flame, And stars to ruin hurled, Thou art the same as when Light first broke on the world.
Our editor sat in his easy chair, And he languidly stroked his golden hair, Whilst he softly whistled the popular air: "Oh willow, tit-willow, tit-willow." For Myops had promised a bright essay, And R. J. M. had an elegant lay, And he hoped for a song from J. E. J., So he whistled "willow, tit-willow." But as he fished-in the ink for flies, A knock on the door made him raise his eyes, (Such honor to him was a great surprise) And he ceased to whistle "tit-willow." Then in walked Myops without the essay, "He could not write it for he was away; But he had upon Spring an exquisite lay." "Oh willow, tit-willow, tit-willow." "Spring," said the editor with a dark frown, "Aye, Spring," said the bard in his sable gown. "And I'll read it sir, if you'll please sit down. And will not interrupt with tit-willow." But scarce to recite it had he begun, When he made for the doorway on the run, For the angry editor got the gun, To give him "tit-willow, tit-willow." Then R. J. M. trembling, tapped at the door, "He had been to a wake the night before, And so—" he hadn't a chance to say more, For groaning "oh willow, tit-willow," The editor grabbed the gun in a fit, But in truth, a barn he could hardly hit, If he fired e'en two yards in front of it, So he didn't give him "tit-willow." Then came there another tap on the door, As his golden locks the editor tore, And his baleful eye-balls threatened gore, Whilst he moodily murmured "tit-willow." "Come in," he shouted; and in walks J. J., "Have you been at a wake, or far away, That you haven't had time to write a lay?" Said the editor, ceasing "tit-willow." "I have not," said J. J., as he dropped a tear, "But I've lost my grandmother, good and dear," (The same he had buried three times this year) And he mournfully sighed "tit-willow." Then the editor swore he was undone, And pulled his moustache; (although he has none, For courtesy's sake, we will give him one,) As he dolefully cried "tit-willow." % And sinking beneath his bitterest grief. He sighed o'er the evils, beyond belief, That await a poor editor-in-chief, Whilst he sobbed in his soul "tit-willow."
A city mouse did condescend Of old, to scale the wall, And on an old-time country friend (Although it might his stiff back bend,) To pay a social call. Poor Rusticus had ne'er before Received so grand a swell. He grudged him not the frugal store Of dainty bits so prized of yore, And acted host right well. A couch of straw, a feast of grain, He brought, and good cheer pressed. His hospitality was vain To bend the citizen's disdain, Or tempt his dainty guest. "My friend," with ill-concealed contempt, The city mouse began, "From death no mortal is exempt, Then why drag out a life unkempt? Be merry while you can. "Come leave this dreary country wood, And lead a city life; There you may pamper every mood, And there be blessed in every good, Where every good is rife." Such airy fancies filled the mind. Of that once thrifty mouse, He seemed unto all reason blind, And airily he left behind His kinsman and his house. They came by night, when no one saw, To the city mouse's mansion. Now royal robes replaced the straw, And pride and food filled Rus's maw, To visible expansion. The city mouse turns host and brings The tasted fruit and berry, And then the two set up for kings, Rejoicing at the change of things, And hours that went so merry. But lo—the folding doors then part, Then fearful of their doom, Both host and guest affrighted start, And round and round in terror dart, Then flee the fatal room. At last when both were safe outside And drew their breath more free, "Good-bye my friend," the bumpkin cried, As off into the fields he hied, "The country will suit me."
As a bee with honey laden From the fragrant bowers, So kind memory comes bringing Rich and precious flowers, From the teeming meadows vast, Of the treasure-freighted past. From the fairy realms of childhood, Sweetest buds she brought, Wearing still their morning jewels By the sunbeams wrought— While the gentle Summer air Steals the perfume folded there. And the hopes so glad and golden In the heart of youth, With its holy aspirations— Seekings after truth, Come again with added glow, From the days of long ago. Priceless gems of wisdom gathered In maturer years; Lessons learned in bitterness, Culled 'mid doubts and fears, Touched by Memory's magic art, Into life and beauty start. Fair magician ! may thy treasures Bring no sadder thought; For the seeds that we are sowing, Seeming now as nought, Live in memories bright or sad, Shadow life or make it glad.
I love my home, my mountain-home! Where fresh winds gayly blow, And flowers of bright and changing hues, In rich profusion grow; Where wild birds warble forth their lays Upon the greenwood tree, — Ah ! that is the spot By the world forgot, So highly prized by me. The murmur of the mountian rill Is music to mine ear, The voice of nature ever speaks In tones I love to hear; Her dim, old forests, shady nooks, And flowers are fair to see, — Oh ! that is the spot By the world forgot, So fondly loved by me. The palace with its stately halls And gay, enchanting bowers, Hath not the charms to soothe the mind In life's tumultous hours; The solemn stillness of the woods, Where nature revels free, — Oh! that is the spot By the world forgot, So often sought by me. The bards may sing of fairer lands, And gayer homes than mine, Where beauties with a haughty bow In costly diamonds shine; I sigh not for their empty pomp, Still, still I would be free To roam o'er that spot By the world forgot, So dearly prized by me.
The leaders sat; the troops enclosed the field, 'Fore these the lord of the seven fold shield Fiercely arose, nigh bursting with disdain ; Eager to plead, unable to restrain His savage ire, upon the shore looked 'round, Where lay the Grecian galleys hauled aground. Then lifting up his hands, " O Jove," he cried, Must then our claims before the fleet be tried ! Boldly the prize Ulysses dares expect, Before that which he durst not once protect; But basely fled on that renowned day, When I fought Hector from his flaming prey. Thus 'tis more prudent, at the clam'rous bar, In speech to vaunt, than to engage in war. In many ways do we uphold our right, Nor were it mine to talk, nor his to fight; On fields of blood I strive to gain renown, While he by laboured language wins his crown. Nor need I name my deeds, for well they're known, Eet him who wars unwitnessed tell his own, And to attest his prowess in the fight, Invoke the watchful stars and conscious night. Great is the prize I seek, I do confess, But such a base opponent makes it less; The prize and honour that he hoped to gain, May give no hope to Ajax to be vain. Ulysses, losing, wins; his name shall be Made noble by defeat, o'ercome by me. E'en were my valour questioned, my high birth, Bevond that plea, would give my title worth. I'm son to Telamon, whose arms allied To Hercules', did erst bend Trojan pride; Great Telamon, with Jason sent from Greece, 'Twas he who brought ye home the Golden Fleece. His sire was Aeacus, who there holds sway Where glide the ghosts of heroes slain in fray, Where Sisyphus of Aeolus the son, Is galled by the heavy, restless stone. Good Aeacus by the god of gods above Begotten was; thus I am third from Jove. Nor would I thus make claim by my descent, Unless, Achilles, thine with mine is blent. A cousin, he, a cousin's arms I claim. What! shall Ulysses graft a foreign name On our old stock, and mix the thievish breed Of Sisyphus with race of heavenly seed ? What, then ! as I unsummoned came to fight, And first to arms, must I forbear my right? For I shunned not the cause, but lent my aid With generous act, while he to fight was made. To the field he came, 'tis true, but in the rear, And well he madness feigned to cover fear; Till one of keener wit disclosed the cheat, And dragged the dastard forth from his retreat. Go. grace ye now a coward with these arms, And him who spurned all honour's trophied palms ; And let me be deprived of kinsman's right Who, ever foremost, bore the brunt of fight. Ye Gods! I would he had at home remained, Or all had b'lieved the fury which he feigned. The less our crime; befrien'ded, he became The voice of sin, to brand the Grecian name.
There’s sunshine in the meadows where The merry mowers go, And pleasantly the scythe-blades click While swinging to and fro. The dews lie sparkling on the grass, The birds are warbling gay, While we with happy hearts go out To toss the fragrant hay. Cool summer zephyrs stir the leaves Upon the maple bough, And in a mellow haze lies wrapped The distant mountain brow. The waters sing a soft, low song, And we some cheery lay, As with our rake and fork we turn, And gather up the hay. The oxen grave as jurymen, Stand chewing side by side, As with a shout the children come To load the hay and ride. And we go back in memory, Through meadows green and gay, And live our childhood o’er again, While gathering in the hay. We’re all haymakers, every one, From peasant to the king, And through the meadow grass of life, We all a scythe do swing. Some lightly, gayly mow along, Some in a bungling way, And some do cut a monstrous swath, In trying to make hay. Some through the pleasant places mow, Some through the bogs and fern, And some stand leaning on their scythes, And wish their luck would turn. Some mow around each bramble bush, And some cut through their way, And never mind a scratch or two, If they but make the hay. Some loiter where the shade-trees are, And some among the flowers, And some go chasing butterflies Through all the brightest hours. Some find their rest in constant toil, Some make their task but play, And all led on by head or heart, . Or both, go making hay.
How desolate were Nature, and how void Of every charm, how like a mighty blank O'erspreading all, were not a present God Beheld employing in its various scenes His active might to animate and-adorn ! What life and beauty, when in all that breathes, Or moves, or grows, His hand is viewed at work ! As when beheld unfolding every bud, Each blossom tingeing, shaping every leaf, Wafting each cloud that passes o'er the sky, Rolling each billow, moving every wing That fans the air, and filling warbling throats Heard in the tuneful woodlands. And alike In all His noblest as His humblest works, Is ever manifest His presence kind; As well in swarms of glittering insects, seen Quick to and fro within a foot of air Dancing a merry hour, then seen no more, As in the system of resplendent worlds Through time revolving in unbounded space. His eye, while yet surveying in one view The whole creation, fixes full on me, As on me shines the sun in its full blaze, While o'er the hemisphere it casts the same; His hand, while holding oceans in its palm, And compassing the skies, surrounds my life; Guards the poor rush-light from the blast of Death.
I walked in the fields when the beam of the morning, In the pale light of beauty streamed o'er the sea; And the glitt'ring dew, in the glow of the dawning, Like a thousand gay jewels shone o'er the lea. "Ah me" sighed a child o'er a bell flower grieving, The tear in his clear liquid eye c f dark blue, •Ah me, that aught lovely could be so deceiving, And what seemed a jewel is nothing but dew." Thus, thus we are flattered by hopes that soon leave us, Thus, thus we pursue the illusions of youth ; So the wrong for the right may pass, and deceive us, Till touched by the wand of the alchemist, Truth. So too, from afar like bright chrysolites beaming, Many shine with a lustre, that is not their own, Whom if we view nearer, we find that their gleaming Is but the chill ray of the dew on the stone.
Loud brazen tongues toll out a knell; The clock now strikes the midnight hour, And echoes, flung from lordly tower To lowly hut, prolong the swell. One moment more, and while we list, To all the hushed, expectant earth, The frosty metal clangs a birth, From steeples, folded in the mist. Oh ! that we might this morn awake From our past sleep, with gathered strength, And from our weakness rouse at length With mighty thews prepared to break The chains that keep us always down; And in our new born selves eschew The gross and false, assume the true; Awake and press to win our crown.
The snow fell, the winds blew Drifts ever higher, And night came, the storm grew Wilder, more dire. > The white streets, the bright lights, Gleamed in the dark, And trees swayed on drear heights, In common and park. A child cried, shivered there, There mid the storm, The world passed nor gazed where That frozen form With blanched face, and wild eyes, Stood still, alone; Nor breath came, nor deep sighs,— His soul had flown. It soared up, it fled far, But ere its’ flight, There gleamed forth a bright star Of wondrous light. The star changed, and lo! see The Child divine; With sweet voice, soft spake He, “ Come, thou art mine. In me rest, my poor son, Thy griefs are o'er, To me fly, a crown is won Forevermore.” They bore up the child’s soul, Up to the skies, Where anthems to God roll In Paradise.
The old clock’s silvery chime, the falling sands Tell of an hour just linked to the past. When Phoebus’ car departing, hurries fast, The day is dead. The beauteous crescent stands, And tells a coming month of woe and cheer. These links of time, the month, the day and hour, Form Spring, the bud, and Summer, the fair flower, Autumn, the falling verdure of the year. The Angelus proclaims, with holier chime, Dawn and the twilight hour. The feast days, too, Mark Heavenly seasons; as with Christmas’ snow Comes that fair flower, full ope’d at Easter-time. Earth seasons calendar a passing spell; But Heaven’s signals endless ages tell.
How oft with eyes of reverence we trace The rare effect of some great artist's skill; And feel our hearts with holy pleasure thrill, When standing 'fore a fair Madonna's face. While gazing, comes the thought; though painting grand Doth charm as doth sweet music's lofty strain, Yet all the toil there spent, is spent in vain , And nought that's useful comes from artist hand. But art, true art doth lend a wondrous aid To man in struggling for his highest end, For oftimes has a picture's beauty made A soul its every sigh to Heaven send. And thus hath art a doubly useful charm, It makes our faith grow strong, our love grow warm.
Clang; from out yon high and darksome tower The sound strikes forth upon the night, Its echoes roll and roll away ; It s murmurs round the belfry play A moment only and take flight. Clang; and now it is a solemn sound, Its brazen throbbings clear and loud Are blent in grand tumultuous strain, And reach a never-ending chain Of pealings to the scurrying cloud. Clang; and let its memory-waking peal, Ere yet the tremblings vanish far, Renew old friendships dear and true, And chafed hearts make firm and new, As near as star is unto star. Clang; and now its slow reverberations Haste echoing down night's sable wing, And bring new life to wearied men, New hopes, new visions and again A firm resolve to better things. Clang; along the sable edge of night, The far-off silvery murmurs roll In tuneful cadence, sweet and long, As if they were undying song, The joy of some undying soul. Clang; and let it s brooding notes of peace, Foretell a brighter, happier time; And sound the end of every feud, And sound the rule of peace renewed, Proclaim the death of coward crime. Clang; the iron tongue beats lustily, And fuses into human hearts A loftier spirit bold and free, The essence of our liberty, Which fearless flauts a tyrant's arts. Clang; and then a deep and quivering throb, With long vibrations dies in air, And flaky nature shakes the while It rings, and all the snowy pile Is rising noiseless everywhere. Clang; the bell, as loud and clear, again Sounds out upon the startled air; Its murmurs reach beyond the sea, And then reverberate to me, While inward voices whisper, prayer. Clang; now with its stroke there comes apace, Or seems to come the voice of friends, Unseen of us, but yet revered, Those friends to every heart endeared By fonder ties, that distance lends. Clang; ere yet the tireless tongue is mute, It brings apace the newer day, The birth of new and fateful hours ; And in the breast of earth are flowers And blossoms of the blossoming May. Clang; and while the bell's faint echoes fade, Soft slumber holds her silent sway; But e'en within the realms of sleep, Its voices whisper warnings deep, And bid us live a righteous day.
Whose life is clean, whose heart is pure, Needs not the quiver, dart or bow Or venomed shaft of treacherous Moor; The just man, Fuscus-, has no foe. One roams through Syrtes' boiling sands, One climbs Caucasia's friendless height, One treads the fancy-haunted lands Hydaspes laps, without affright. As pure as they, one day, I strolled Through a Sabine forest, free from care; And thinking of my love, I trolled A song to Lalage, the fair. Beyond the boundary of the wood, Lonely, and not alone, I strayed; When 10, there in my pathway stood A wolf; he looked, then fled afraid, — Afraid of me, my Fuscus dear, Your friend, your Horace, all unarmed. The good, you see, need never fear; Where'er they go, they go unharmed. Bold Daunia's acorns never fed, And Juba's realms, the parched nurse Of lions, never surely bre(i This monster's like, the bad man's curse. There is where stretch the sterile plains, Where summer breezes never woo The trees to bloom ; there is where rains And vile winds fairly chill you through. There is a spot in Afric lands, Too near the sun's bright, circling car, Where glistening spread the whitened sands, Where mortals ever houseless are. Put me, my friend, where'er you will, Or near, or far, your Horace still His Lalage will always sing; He'll love her laugh, He'll love her chaff; She's such a sweet and winsome thing.
The orb of night with silver beauty rims The fleeting clouds, and soft star lustre dims; O'er mountain peak it showers its mellow beams, And turns to silver gently flowing streams. It smiles to see its radiant features shine From out the rippling mirror of the brine, And deep its light in each dark billow laves, That bears it broken on to fellow-waves : Till thus seems formed upon the trackless sea A golden pathway to eternity. In silent toil the hardy fisher sets Across the ebbing tide his ready nets, And gives the flame to those bright lamps, that burn Upon his seine. And oft to these doth turn His watchful eye, as down the murmuring stream They slowly float. For their clear ruddy gleam Are beacons o'er a track, to which the gaze Of him, who watches where the wavelet plays Upon the banks o'erspread with verdure green, Must run to reach his idly-moving seine. Behold another sight on Ganges tide, Where dreamy shallops at their moorings ride. Two Hindoo maidens on the river's edge Set their bright lamps. For they, who once did pledge Them life's affection, now are called to roam On distant journey, far from friends and home. One ruby light is floating slowly on In wave-rocked motion, like the dying swan, That hymns her death-song as she goes to rest; Its softened gleams fade in the golden west. The other light sails gently by its side. But soon grows dim beneath the wind-stirred tide. And she, whose lamp has always brightly burned, Touched by no wave, and by no ripple turned From out its course, rejoices, for she knows That this her lover's safe returning shows. But the bright lamp that sinks beneath the wave, Tells for the other's love an early grave. With its last dying ray her joy must cease, Thenceforth she lives in sad and mournful peace. Life, changeable life, is but a flowing stream, Whereon the light of faith, its moon, doth gleam, And light away, that all must traverse o'er, Who seek sweet rest on fair Elysium's shore. We are the fishers, and upon our seine, That we might get God's saving grace therein, The lamps of lowly reverence we burn, Of hope undying and of virtue stern. For in their gleaming tracks our high minds see The glittering pathways to eternity. As each pure soul is journeying through this night, It sets on life's dark, broadening wave the light Of spotless innocence, and God's sweet grace. Sorrow and penance now with him have place, Whose light temptation from its doth guide, And sad offences quench beneath the tide. Happy the one, whose ardent light doth rise O'er every hostile wave of sins device; Preserve undimmed the flame, that first was given, And blend its brightness with the brighter Heaven.
All day my heart, oppressed with grief and care, Had sought for peace and comfort everywhere, At work, at play, till wandering o'er the iand I stood at length upon the ocean's strand, When crimson curtains round the setting sun And falling twilight told that day was done. And, as I mused, the waves from o'er the main Took up my cares, and then rolled back again. Till sorrow gone and grief left far behind, More joyous thoughts usurped mj' ready mind. Who can express the feelings of delight, The silent thoughts awakened at the sight, When first the ocean's grandeur meets the ej-e Bound only by the azure-arched sky! We gaze upon the deep, the dark blue sea, We think of heaven, and of eternity, Of power, of strength, and of the endless time With God the Father, Mighty and Sublime. In playful calm, or when about the shore The winds arouse the sad sea's sullen roar, It seems a mirror of the human soul New calm and peaceful, now beyond control. The bright blue waves of every summer sea Come singing to the shore in mirthful glee; Nor heed the wrecking of their hopes at hand, Till formless dashed upon the foam-strewn sand. And thus it is in life and in our breasts, Gay hopes arise and show their gleaming crests, Youth's fondly-cherished ties, bright dreams of fame, Earth's truest friendships and a shining name; But one by one they lift their heads and die, And on life's sands the cherished visions lie. When gloomy thoughts enwrap the dreamy soul, And weary hearts resound their bitter dole, The sea approaches with its weary heart, Sighs with a grief too tranquil to depart, And seems in accents ever sweet and low To sympathize with man's complaining woe. So when success rewards some cherished plan, And long-sought triumph fills the breast of man, 'Tis sweet to hear the music of the sea, Intoning ceasless songs of victory.
Leader of the wondrous legions ! Chieftain of the mighty bands ! That through earth's re notest regions, O'er her wildest, loneliest lands, Send thy soldiers, calm and daring, Vowed to service all divine, Love's immortal banner bearing, Blazoned with His saving Sign ! O ! can title greater, grander, Crown ol dauntless warrior be, Than the one, thou blest commander! By thine armies twined for thee, When, in thy strong arm confiding, (That so oft had crushed the foe) They first chose thy glorious guiding, More than sixty years ago ? Ah ! celestial inspiration Never showed a safer guide. For the blest work of Salvation Ne'er on firmer strength relied, Never named a nobler leader To the blissful promised land, Never bade more potent pleader Heavenward lift his suppliant hand. Worthy son of grand Ignatius ! Of the pure and peerless Knight, Who, from lands and castles spacious, And from longed-for fields of fight Turned with steps that would not falter, And in lonely vigil, laid Meekly, on Our Lady's allar Steadfast heart and shining blade, And the nobler Knighthood founded, Of the sweet, all-saving name, And its battle tocsin sounded, And its glorious chief became. Spread ere long his wondrous legions Through the error-poisoned lands, Till, o'er earth's remotest regions Bravely trod those hero-bands, Winning, as the silent ages Sped adown the aisles of Time, Conquests meet for angel-pages, Bloodless victories sublime. While in ceaseless, grand succession Came the valiant chiefs who led That most wonderful procession, Marching on with tireless tread. And of all the glorious leaders In that blest unbroken line, (Bravest chieftains, potent pleaders, Heralds of the King Divine), None, than thou , were braver, grander, 'Mid these blest heroic ones, Matchless General! Meet Commander Of Loyola's valiant sons ! None to deeds of loftier daring Sent the Jesuit hosts sublime, Cross-emblazoned banners bearing Undismayed, from clime to clime. Undismayed, though demon Error Wide his haughty flag unfurled, And his grisly forms of terror Rose to aid his slave, the world. Slandered, robbed, imprisoned, banished, Bravely still the heroes wrought, While full many a Herod vanished, Slain by Him whose " life he sought." Never once thy warriors yielded ; Firm, as in the ages fled, Stood they, by thy pleadings shielded, By thy mandates safely led. Well, then, son of great Ignatius ! From thy loved and loving Lord, May'st thou claim His greeting gracious, And His infinite reward. " Come ! " he saith, t; O, soldier loyal! Sheath thy sword, and take thy rest, With my white-robed princes royal, With thy brethren brave and blest. Loftiest place in realms eternal Shalt thou with thy legions claim, Strongest foes of hosts infernal! Truest wearers of My Name! "
I walked along the ocean shore, And saw the white-winged ships go by; I heard the mighty waters roar, And watched the fearless sea-birds fly. I traced the slowly ebbing tide, To where the rocks rose from the deep, And in the streaming grass I spied A sea-shell nestling in its sleep. I touched it, all aglow for fear, It trilled the music of its days; At times 'twas far, at times 'twas near, As memory woke its soul to praise. It told me of its palace home, ' Mid rolling plains of treasured gold, Where hand in hand coy mermaids roam, And sea-kings fairy revels hold; Where sightless eyes in gladness gleam Through gems and pearls of fairest hue; Where fields unploughed with harvests team ; A changeless scene forever new.
Come, drink the sparkling wine; And in joyous dances whirling Beat the earth, O comrades mine, To the music of gladness at freedom's flag unfurling. Deck the War Gods' couches, priest; We will hold the Salian feast; ' T is meet, for terror's reign has ceased. Erstwhile it were a sin To draw from out its bin In cellars ancestral, the good Caecubian wine; When the Queen, by fury driven, Would our firm old State have riven, And ruin wrought to our Capitoline. Surrounded by that crew defiled Of fever-wasted men, the sport Of every vice,— great heroes, they! — the child Of Egypt's Pride, by Fortune's sweets made wild, Through drunken thoughts dared every hope and smiled; A maddened Queen with drunken court. Proud Egypt's Fury blushed to shame, When one ship only sped from out the flame. As hawks swoop down on timid doves, As cunning hunters track the hare, that loves To trace its journey on Haemonia's snow, A reckless guide to its mirth-loving foe, Thus Caesar plied his oars with quickened stroke In Egypt's wake, and dull fear found a home, Where erst the Mareotic wine awoke Her frenzied mind to hurl its doom on Rome. That monster Fate had made a queen, Caesar would make his captive slave. Far sweeter death, than to demean Her birth by such a hap. She feared No sword, nor sought to save Her shattered hopes by flight; not e'en The gloom through which no light has peered, Shall shroud her ship. One woman shall be brave. Upon her fallen throne she looked serene, Amid the ruin dared to be its queen; She dared to hold within her grasp, And tease to fury the venomed asp; To drink into her frame the flood That darkened all her glorious blood. Made fiercer by her purpose free, She died. Because she scorned the captive's hold In the rude galleys of Liburnians bold. She '11 grace no haughty victor's train, A captive bound by galling chain :
The gay lights shone from the mountain height, And sparkled on the frozen mere, The dumb snow fell, the chapel bell Rang merrily for gladness near. Glad were the valleys that Christmas night, Glad were the hills with new-found mirth. The leafless tree had its song of glee, To greet the hour of the Saviour's birth. Sweet were the sounds, as the light sleigh sped, With its freight of happy hearts, o'er the snow, To the Midnight Mass, in the mountain pass, Like a fairy scene in the long ago. A little one lies on his downy bed, Dreaming, as only children dream, Of laughing fays and golden Mays. And shallops blown o'er a dream-born stream. Up from the valley comes a Child; Love-laden is the tree He bears, A sweet surprise for sleeping eyes, And the little heart that all things dares To ask, and hope from Jesu mild. He hears the Christ-Child fondly say: " Christmas is here, be glad, my dear; May Christmas joy keep you alway."
There are snow-drifts in the hollows, Robed in white the sullen glens, Where in summer skimmed the swallows, Sped the slender-winged wrens ; From the hardy North comes winter bold, His frosty sway to hold. From the fragile boughs are shaken Feathery tufts of downy snow, Where the crisp north winds awaken Shrill, cold echoings, as they blow; For the Winter King has pressed his hand Upon the helpless land. Haste thee, haste thee to the river Where the merry skaters glide, Setting all the air aquiver, Slipping o'er the frozen tide, For the stream has felt the icy sting Of winter's roving king. Silvery sheen the moon is flinging Broadly o'er the glittering white, From afar come voices singing Through the arches of the night; And the hoary monarch proudly reigns In his usurped domains.
The wan Editor desolate sat at his desk, — At his desk all alone in the STYLUS'S room ; Much aflame were his eyes, and prodigious his sighs, And, in truth, you'd have thought him the essence of gloom. Were his heart-strings unstrung? Had his favorite cat, With the music of voice, that belongs to the race, Quick evanished from life, while the urchin was rife, And the shot-gun's sure message her purring effaced? Had a College Exchange sent a withering shaft Of its venom-tipped matter to fester his heart? Had the STYLUS lost fame, or been called a hard name, Or been praised for its broadening margins and art? None of these. And the cause would you know? 'Twas but this, — He'd been trying his best for a month and a day From his brain to evoke one small Anarchist joke For the Domi's dull space; and the fates said him nay.
Like some fair stream upon its sparkling way, That runs in music o'er a pebbly bed, And catching, as it leaps, the golden ray Of heavenly light, bends it to shades o'erhead, Or gliding through the haunt of sylvan fay, Past flowerets wild, with sweetest fragrance fed, Emerges glorious with the waning day, While sky-born splendors in the West are shed, Philosopher, O Leo, truth's pure light Reflected from thy musing soul, knows bliss In banished error from our darkened sphere; Poet, immortal chant of thine the right Bedecks with hues the fairest fancies kiss, And charms unto belief the raptured ear.
As pontiff, priest, we scan thy high-wrought deeds. Like shepherd thou, upon the mountain side, Who keeps with wakeful care his sheep and leads Afar from dens where wolfish prowlers bide. Apostle-like thou standst.— Christ speaks, and heeds The froward deep, while Peter's net with wide Distended bulk enforces sweaty beads From toilers on the world's dark teeming tide. In priestly state the marks of holy zeal Have shown thy eager love and soulful care. Christ's flocks in thee a faithful shepherd know. Lo ! where the waters stretch the fisher's keel! 'Tis Peter's, thine ! Heaped up the freight and rare Thou bringest shorewards in the sunset's glow.
The brightest stars that twinkle in the sky, Like far-off beacons in the firmament, Embosomed in night's splendor peaceful lie, And earthward shed their rays with glory blent; Each beam away to light man's eager eye Through this dark world to rest and sweet content, — To court our weary feet to realms on high, Where gladness crowns the soul with sorrow spent. Thou Light in Heaven ! Thou glorious star of day ! The darkness of our time thy rays have riven. Faith kisses science ; learning weds with truth ; Might is a suppliant on thy glorious way; Weakness thy throne, made firm with strength from heaven; Age crowns with fullness promise-golden youth.
The themometer registered four below, A blizzard blew cold from the North When the poet's soul, in an overflow Of melody, thus gushed forth : " The scent-laden zephyrs were blowing Fleecy cloudlets, like sails on the sea." What mattered it that it was snowing, And the night was as dark as could be? Thus he sang on and completed His verse, ere he took him to slumber. And the poem, the ' Stylus ' accepted— In time for the midsummer number.
Ah, Postumus, my Postumus, The fleet years glide away ; No piety can win for us From wrinkles brief delay. Age threatens with its gasping breath; No might can stay the conqueror death. Hope not, though thrice you sacrifice, Each day, a hecatomb, To soften Pluto's tearless eyes, Who holds immured in gloom Of Stygian waters Tityus bold, And Geryon's triply monstrous mould. Those waters must be crossed by all, Who eat of Nature's yield, The ruler of the kingly hall, The tiller of the field. In vain we shun Mars sprent with blood, And seething Hadria's storm-tost flood. In vain, at Autumn's fall, we fear, When baleful south-winds blow. Our eyes must see the dark, dull mere, Cocytus, winding slow, — Must see the ill-famed Danaids moil. And Sisyphus at his endless toil. From land, from hearth-stone, from thy fair, Fond help-meet must thou flee; Of trees thou tendest now with care, One only follows thee, The hated cypress, to the tomb, To wrap its short-lived lord in gloom. The worthier heir of all thy hoard Shall drink off to the lees The rich old Caecuban now stored Beneath a hundred keys, And rarer wines thy floor shall stain Than those which feasting pontiffs drain.
There once was a man, (And this information I obtained from a man, Whose sole occupation Was to study the legends of every nation, Who imagined one day (And it made his hair start, While cold grew his blood In each vivified part) That he'd swallowed a lizard While taking a sup Of aqua called pura From out of a cup. Now what could he do? (Don't forget, by the way, This was hundreds of decades Ere your or my day) No stomach-pump handy, No antidote near, Instead of emetics, A cart-load of fear. What would you do, Supposing you'd swallowed a snake? Why, you'd call Dr. Dunn, Or, perhaps, Dr. Blake. But this man who lived once, (And, pray, just look here, The men who lived once Are increasing each year; For no man lives twice In this world, at least, And the same thing holds true Of bird, fish, and beast,) Instead of consulting a Harvard M. D., Asked old, grape-vine Bacchus To set the snake free, From stomach or colon Or where'er he might be. And, like Pan, who although A first-class musician, Plays gratis, so Bacchus, A tip-top physician, Who got a diploma In old days Egyptian, Charges nought, I am told, For his ancient prescription. And the man who lived once, Glass on glass he imbibed Of the magical potion Which Bacchus prescribed. Hot and hot grew his blood And lively his brain, Forgetful of lizard, Forgetful of pain. But suddenly chills Crept over his frame, And well-known sensations In big legions came, Succeeded at length By terrible shakes, Till, instead of one lizard, His mind saw ten snakes. So this man who lived once, (Only once, please remember; I believe that he died Some time in December) By his own life, profusely, You see, illustrated A moral too good To be e'er underrated, That often, too often, Or as oft as you please, The cure, yes, the cure, — May be worse than disease.
Revered, fond cherished, thou who satst Above my auburn locks enthroned, — My Vacuum's lost monarch, sore bemoaned, Where art thou now, my Sunday hat? Oft have I brushed, caressed thee too; Oft touched thee gaily to the fair; Oft spriteful tossed thee high in air.— Say, topst thou now a frowsy Jew? Alas, thy brief day o'er! His face Who thee dethroned was dug with scars, His breath a gust of foul cigars, And like a coward dog his pace. Within fair Boston's rich-booked fane The wretch advanced with thieving hand ; Deep slept that hour the guardian band Of civic law's blue-coated reign. A moment! and the deed was done! My new chapeau was gone, my best! A withered Derby's wrinkled crest Grinned in its place of sordid dun. What time Mercurial fingers doff Thee, think of him who paid for thee. O think of him, whose curses free Fall on the man who whipped thee off.
The lands that first the Genoese to light Disclosed, the vast Americas, unite In embassy to him whom sovereign Rome Her Thirteenth Leo names, and, greeting, come To join with sister countries, and extend His joy of golden years from end to end Of earth, in jubilees of praise, and lay Their grateful homage at his feet to-day. Young, full of hope, and free, Columbia kneels To tell with loyal heart the thanks she feels For Leo's special love and aid; to own His zeal, that gathered round his sacred throne, And taught her pastors chief, and made them call Their mitred brethren all to council-hall, In parent Baltimore, to organize Her Church, and closer draw the holy ties Of union, while, in beaming kindliness O'er all, his pictured self looked down to bless Their work, and aid the legate of his choice, Great Carroll's heir, whom late his sovereign voice To purple honors called. ♦ His blessing made Her college here in Rome what fealty-grade And learning claimed, pontifical; and fired With zeal to raise her people, he inspired And blessed her primal university, And named the nation's capital to be Its home, and its first Rector gifted Keane. Through him she counts another score Of mitred sons, and ten that honored more The pallium bear; a Seghers, he whose soul Found God in duty at the martyr's goal; An Elder, Ryan, Corrigan; a throng Where piety, eloquence, vigilance belong, All that ennobles; in the diadem Of hierarchal glory each a gem. The tranquil Canadas their tokens bring Of thankfulness and joy, remembering His organizing hands, that brought the calm Of peace upon their church, that sought to arm With newer force their prelate band, and raised To Cardinal's degree whom learning praised And native worth and toil extolled, and named Archpastor him whom zeal and duty claimed, Or made whom sacrifices called to bear The prelate's mingled dignity and care, An hierarchy nobly pledged to raise Their Church and light her path to brighter days. The Mexic land her homage sends, in thought Aud gratitude of Leo's zeal, that sought So long from banded secrecy to save Her holy Church—his parent care that gave Her pastor band its merited increase, And her tired people days of longed-for peace. Where rolls the Amazon past woody banks, Brazil to him her offering sends and thanks, Who three times filled her pastors' thinning ranks; Or where Peru upon the Andes lies, Or where Bolivian hills perpetual rise, Or Chili's length or Argentine's expanse, Or Ecuador, relate their large advance In faith through him; where New Granada feels His gentle hand, or Venezuela kneels By summer seas, a million voices blend In praise of him, and joyful offerings send. And thus the Western world its homage lays At Leo's feet, with sister lands, and prays : "May God preserve him long and may his Light Be dawn of peace at end of conflict's night.
Linger still, linger still, Joys of our boyhood days ; Charm and thrill, charm and thrill, Joys of our boyhood days, Sweetly our souls with rapture fill, — Flee not away, but longer thrill, Thrill us with merry lays, Wljile the happy day, while the fleeting day speeds. Laugh and play, laugh and play; Pleasure will die at last; Laugh and play, laugh and play: Age is coming fast. But memory ever in shallop gay Shall float us aback to life's bright May, Where blossoms the golden past. Stay, O happy days, stay, O merry days, stay.
What makes the Saint whose memory we crown With love? Not shouts of an admiring throng, Or fame that wings its way the years along, And rests upon the hill-tops of renown; Not dauntless breast, that bears the cuff and frown Of hate, in strife against a people's wrong; Not power of purse, nor title to a name That is, too oft, alas! though sung in song, The heritage of shame. What makes the saint? The true heroic soul That holds to conscience both in blame and praise, When sorrow palls, when gladness lights its ways; High hopes to be despised for Christ; control Of self, when waves of passion roll; Integrity of life, wherein the rays Of searching jealousy can find no dross; Love-born desire to carry, all our days, The burden of the cross.
Swiftly do the moments glide, Ending every youthful dream, But their memories will abide, As the flowing of a stream. Leaves will scatter, flowers will fade Bare the branches be and still, Yet the friends our youth has made Each deep void of heart shall fill. Time may sever, oceans rend Those who shared a happy past, Fervent whisperings of a friend Live enshrined unto the last. Waving hand and mournful glance, And the eyes that dimmed with tears, Slowly fading, will perchance Meet again in after years. So in memories do we live Linked with bonds of kindly love; And the sighs of heart will give Strength to friendships born above.
In life's bright morn the poet thought To twine a laurel for his brow, Alas, the fancies that he wrought Are perished now. Like Pallas from the head of Jove, His thoughts burst from his teeming brain ; By the Pierian springs he wove His lyric strain. He winged him 'gainst life's dazzling glare And faced it with an eagle gaze, With confidence of might to dare Untrodden ways. The ceaseless labor that he gave To climb the trackless steeps to fame, Was vain; he lies within a grave, An unknown name.
The sleeping earth old Winter's storms Have with a snowy covering decked; Still, still in sleep, not death, she lies Till Spring her charms again has waked. And just as children void of care, Repose upon a mother's breast, So too the sleeping flow'rets find In her protection grateful rest. There dream they of the pleasant breeze, The sparkling dew, the sunlit day, And see, exhaling sweet perfumes, The forest green, the meadows gay. They hear the carolling of the birds, The wavelets beating on the sand; Hold converse with the butterflies, And greet the beehive's buzzing band. The flowers awake from their long sleep, Display their splendor far and near; — All vanished is the pleasant dream, And lo! the Spring is truly here.
Whence comes this sorrow, I know not; Yet my heart is o'erburdened with woe, A scene to my vision returning, From the days of the long ago. The air is cool; in the twilight The Rhine flows peacefully on, The peaks of the mountains are glorious In the blaze of the setting sun. A maiden of wondrous beautv Is seated above on the height; She combs her tresses of amber That gleam in the waning light. With a golden comb she combs them, And carols a plaintive tune, That floats o'er the restless waters 'Neath the light of the rising moon. The mariner rapt on the billows Is waked with a sudden grief; For he hears the voice of the maiden, But sees not the treacherous reef. And I know that the cruel waters, As they roll and foam along, Will bury him deep in their furrows, His dirge, the fair svren's song.
Come where the flickering firelight sheds Its shadows as the night hours fly; We'll weave a web from the broken threads Of memories of the days gone by; We'll think of things that ever please The heart that lists for old-time lays; We'll place the Stylus on our knees, And dream the dreams of by-gone days. Where are the bright young wits that met About the board in college times, And sang the thoughts that linger yet Like echoes of the distant chimes Of far off bells? Their forms arise Around me in the still of night, And I catch the gleam of their laughing eyes In the firelight when it gleams most bright. No more their merry footstep falls Upon the playground’s flattened stone; No more they crowd the College halls; The World hath claimed them as its own. But Memory brings them back once more, Like truants to the mother’s knee, And hears the tearful tale they pour In ears that listen lovingly. And who shall write the record down Of all the deeds that they have done? And who shall sing the proud renown Of all the glory they have won? Their children, —they whose youthful grace Adorns the places they have held, Each passing honor still shall trace And sing the vanished days of eld. For us that still are tossed about, From danger unto danger hurled, What hope shall bring the message out From Alma Mater to the world? The message lies in thy dear leaves Whose every line excites the tears Of him that dreams and dreaming grieves For hopes that died in vanished years.
A song on Spring I fain would write. All poets sing A song on Spring; But, strangest thing! My Muse takes flight, When songs on Spring I fain would write.
Deep gloom and darkness over time Were brooding, heaven’s gates sublime Were locked and barred, Creation’s plan was marred By stain of Parents’ crime; When lo ! a seer’s prophetic ken Reveals these tidings unto men ; “ A child at length “ Shall come with love and strength “ To ope the gates again.” In eastern land, long years agone, While stars in azure brightly shone With kindly light One mystic, wintry night, Some peaceful shepherds watched —anon Their ears are filled with marvellous song, And radiant spirits throng on throng Appearing sing This new, this wondrous thing — The Prince of Peace shall right all wrong. “ In swaddling clothes — behold the sign — “ Enwrapped he lies'near sleeping kine “ In cavern dim. “ Arise, go worship Him, “ Immanuel, the child Divine.” O God ! in Bethlehem’s cave forlorn, Where royal trappings nought adorn. In manger’s straw The wondering shepherds saw A babe, the Prince of Peace new-born. The Lord of Israel’s prophet kept His word, the serpent’s head is crushed; Expectant man in gladness wept, And sighs of sin-born slaves are hushed. The branch of Palm with holy care Was brought that night by angel’s hand To Juda’s soil, and planted there; Transplanted thence throughout the land. O Prince of Peace, give unto me A share in that peace eternal, Break sinful bonds and set me free To enter through gates supernal.
