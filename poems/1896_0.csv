And where has baby been,
The toddling little mite?
Lo ! here she comes again
Preparing for a fight.
She's brandishing a knife,
A carver too at that!
Oh ! bless her little life,
She lunges at the cat.
The mother runs apace
And stops the deadly work,
When off again goes Grace
And back she brings a fork.
The fork is scarce put by,
Away flies little Tot;
And here she comes
O my !
A poker blazing hot.
The poker's put away,
The nurse is called in haste;
But Baby will not stay,
She has no time to waste.
And so again she's off,
I wonder what comes next:
A hat-pin sure enough,
And Tot is looking vexed.
But Grace has got to yield
Her latest, dearest prize ;
Again she fares afield
A needle huge in size !
When her supply is gone
Of every sharp-edged tool,
Then Gracey climbs upon
The new piano-stool.
From early morn till night
Mamma is in a fret.
May guardian angels bright
Protect her little pet.

The little toy dog is covered with dust,
But sturdy and staunch he stands;
And the little toy soldier is red with rust,
And his musket moulds in his hands.
Time was when the little toy dog was new,
And the soldier was passing fair;
And that was the time when our Little Boy Blue
Kissed them and put them there.
" Now, don't you go till I come," he said,
" And don't you make any noise ! "
So, toddling off to his trundle bed,
lie dreamt of the pretty toys;
And as he was dreaming, an angel song
Awakened our Little Boy Blue
Oh ! the years are many, the years are long,
But the little toy friends are true!
Aye, faithful to Little Boy Blue they stand,
Each in the same old place
Awaiting the touch of a little hand,
The smile of a little face;
And they wonder, as waiting the long years through
In the dust of that little chair,
What has become of our Little Boy Blue
Since he kissed them and put them there.

Little All-Aloney's feet
Pitter-patter in the hall,
And his mother runs to meet
And to kiss her toddling sweet,
Ere perchance he fall.
He is, oh, so weak and small!
Yet what danger shall he fear
When his mother hovereth near,
And he hears her cheering call:
" All-Aloney?"
Little All-Aloney's face
It is all aglow with glee,
As around that romping-place
At a terrifying pace
Lungeth, plungeth he!
And that hero seems to be
All unconscious of our cheers
Only one dear voice he hears
Calling reassuringly :
" All-Aloney! "
Ah, that in the years to come,
When he shares of Sorrow's store, ?
When his feet are chill and numb,
When his cross is burdensome,
And his heart is sore:
Would that he could hear once more
The gentle voice he used to hear
Divine with mother love and cheer
Calling from yonder spirit shore :
"All, all alone ! "

I thought myself, indeed, secure
So fast the door, so firm the lock;
But lo ! he toddling comes to lure
My parent ear with timorous knock.

My heart were stone could it withstand
The sweetness of my baby's plea,
That timorous, baby knocking and
" Please let me in,
it's only me."
I threw aside the unfinished book,
Regardless of its tempting charms,
And, opening wide the door, I took
My laughing darling in my arms.
Who knows but in Eternity,
I, like a truant child, shall wait
The glories of a life to be,
Beyond the Heavenly Father's gate?
And will that Heavenly Father heed
The truant's supplicating cry,
As at the outer door I plead,
" 'Tis I, O Father! only I? "

I count my treasures o'er with care,
A little toy my darling knew,
A little sock of faded hue,
A little lock of golden hair.
Long years ago this holy time,
My little one my all to me
Sat robed in white upon my knee,
And heard the merry Christmas chime.
" Tell me, my little golden-head,
If Santa Claus should come to-night,
What shall he bring my baby bright,
What treasure for my boy? " I said.
And then he named this little toy,
While in his round and mournful eyes
There came a look of sweet surprise,
That spake his quiet, trustful joy.
And as he lisped his eyening prayer
He asked the boon with childless grace;
Then toddling to the chimney place,
He hung his little stocking there.
That night, while lengthening shadows crept,
I saw the white-winged angels come
With singing to our lowly home
And kiss my darling as he slept.
They must haye heard his little prayer,
For in the morn, with rapturous face,
He toddled to the chimney-place,
And found this little treasure there.
Thev came again one Christmas-tide,
That angel host, so fair and white;
And singing all that glorious night,
They lured my darling from my side.
A little sock, a little toy,
A little lock of golden hair,
The Christmas music on the air,
A-watching for my baby boy !
But if again that angel train
And golden-head come back for me,
To bear me to Eternity,
My watching will not be in vain.

As to-night you came your way,
Bearing earthward heavenly joy,
Tell me, O dear saint, I pray,
Did you see my little boy?
By some fairer voice beguiled,
Once he wandered from my sight;
He is such a little child,
He should have my love this night.
It has been so many a year,
Oh, so many a year since then !
Yet he was so very dear,
Surely he will come again.
If upon your way you see
One whose beauty is divine,
Will you send him back to me?
He is lost,'and he is mine.
Tell him that his little chair
Nestles where the sunbeams meet,
That the shoes he used to wear
Yearn to kiss his dimpled feet.
Tell him of each pretty toy
That was wont to share his glee;
Maybe that will bring my boy
Back to them and back to me.
O dear saint, as on you go
Through the glad and sparkling frost,
Bid those bells ring high and low
For a little child that's lost!
O dear saint, that blessest men
With the grace of Christmas joy,
Soothe this heart with love again,
Give me back my little boy!

Have you ever heard of the Sugar-Plum Tree?
'Tis a marvel of great renown !
It blooms on the shore of the Lollipop sea
In the garden of Shut-Eye Town ;
The fruit that it bears is so wondrously sweet
(As those who have tasted it say)
That good little children have only to eat
Of that fruit to be happy next day.
When you've got to the tree, you would have a hard time
To capture the fruit which I sing;
The tree is so tall that no person could climb
To the boughs where the sugar plums swing!
But up in that tree sits a chocolate cat,
And a gingerbread dog prowls below
And this is the way you contrive to get at
Those sugar plums tempting you so.
You say but the word to that gingerbread dog,
And he barks with such terrible zest
That the chocolate cat is at once all agog,
As her swelling proportions attest.
And the chocolate cat goes cavorting around
From this leafy limb unto that,
And the sugar plums tumble, of course, to the ground.
Hurrah for that chocolate cat!
There are marshmallows, gumdrops, and peppermint canes,
With striping of scarlet or gold,
And you carry away of the treasure that rains
As much as your apron can hold !
So come, little child, cuddle closer to me
In your dainty white nightcap and gown,
And I'll rock you away to that Sugar-Plum Tree
In the garden of Shut-Eye Town.

Every evening, after tea,
Teeny-Weeny comes to me,
And, astride my willing knee,
Plies his lash and rides away;
Though that palfrey, all too spare,
Finds its burden hard to bear,
Teeny-Weeny doesn't care :
lie commands, and I obey.
So I feel a tender pride
In my boy who dares to ride
That fierce horse of his astride,
Off into those misty lands ;
And as on my breast he lies,
Dreaming in that wondrous wise,
I caress his folded eyes,
Pat his little dimpled hands.
On a time he went away.
Just a little while to stay,
And I'm not ashamed to say
I was very lonely then;
Life without him was so sad,
You can fancy I was glad
And made merry when I had
Teeny-Weeny back again !
So of evenings, after tea,
When he toddles up to me
And goes tugging at my knee,
You should hear his palfrey neigh !
You should see him prance and shy,
When, with an exulting cry,
Teeny-Weeny, vaulting high,
Plies his lash and rides away !

When Christmas time rolls round each year
Does very much our spirits cheer.
The wise men from land afar
Were led to Bethlehem by star.


Is it wrong? Well may be;
But I'm going, boys, all the same.
Do they think me a burgher's baby
To be scared by a scolding name?
They may argue and prate and order;
Go tell them to save their breath,
Then over the Transvaal border,
And gallop for life or death.
Right sweet is the marksman's rattle,
And sweeter the cannon's roar,
But 'tis bitterly hard to battle
Beleaguered, and one to four.
I can tell you it wasn't a trifle
To swarm over Kriigersdorp glen,
As they plied us with round and rifle,
And ploughed us again and again.
I suppose we were wrong
were madmen ;
Still I think at the judgment day,
When God sifts the good from the bad men,
There'll be something more to say.
We were wrong, but we aren't half sorry,
And as one of the baffled band,
I would rather have had that foray
Than the crushings of all the Rand.

When only a babe at the bottle,
I started my fulling career ;
My dolly I took by the throttle
And pulled off its head from the rear.
The curls of my little brother
I oftentimes pulled in a pet;
And then pulled away from my mother
I see her a-spanking me yet.
In spite of my aptness in pulling,
I never could pull through in school;
I'd rather go fishing or sculling
And pull in a perch on my spool.
I next became a conductor
And pulled an old bell-rope for years ;
And then I evolved to a sexton
And pulled in the parish for prayers.
I ran for the office of Alderman
And won , but I pulled a few wires ;
There wasn't a man in the district
That had such a pull as Fritz Meyers.
And now I've evolved to a dentist,
And reached my perfection, they say;
I stick in my pincers at random
And pull out both molars and pay.
I'm dangling a shingle in Texas
That pulls people in from the plains ;
FRITZ MEYERS, AN ELEGANT DENTIST,
EXTRACTS ALL YOUR TEETH WITH GREAT PAINS.

" So Ed. from overwork is dead?
The lazy lad was far advanced?"
" Upon his books he kept his head,
So Ed. from overwork is dead.
His sight was weak and hence, he said,
He never knew when Teacher glanced.
So Ed. from overwork is dead.
The lazy lad is far advanced."

Hail to the King!
The Saviour of man is born.
The glorious angels sing
Hail to the King !
In the air doth ring
On this blessed morn
Hail to the King !
The Saviour of man is born.

"This is Levi's birthday, Abel,
What's your gift for little Dolly? "
" Wash the window, dearest Mabel,
And let him see the trolley."

Dear little Sanctuary light,
Guard well thy care ;
Keep His home always bright,
Dear little Sanctuary light,
All through the lonely night
Comfort Him there.
Dear little Sanctuary light,
Guard well thy care.

Pure as morning light,
Like a lily white,
Lovely to the sight
In simple robe arrayed.
Like a lily white
Is the Holy Maid.

The mannish Miss Strider in bloomers,
Is as bad as she possibly can ;
To women in skirts on the sidewalk
She raises her hat like a man.

A little rat
In terror sat:
A crouching cat
Eyes little rat.
A spring ? the rat
Within the cat
In terror sat.
Poor little rat!

Rejoice, and men will seek you :
Grieve, and they turn and go :
They want full measure of all your pleasure
But they do not need your woe.

With a bad cigar
In his mouth,
He took a car;
With a bad cigar
He rode not far
They threw him out
With a bad cigar
In his mouth.

Shall we call it " naughty naught? "
Will that abbreviation do?
" Naughty ones," what have you thought?
Shall we call it " naughty naught?"
You, next year, will you be brought
To hold yourself as " naughty too? "
Shall we call it naughty naught? "
Will that abbreviation do?
