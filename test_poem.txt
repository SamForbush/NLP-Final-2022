Just as the sounds of the Christmas chime
Are passing away from the earth,
Tremulous still with the truth sublime,
That crowns a midnight to brighten all time
With the light of the wondrous Birth,
I come but a lowly and humble thing,
Will you give me a welcome true?
Over me waves the beautiful wing
Of the Mystery whose Gloria's echoes ring,
In gladness for me and for you.
For sake of the time with mysteries sweet,
For sake of the crib and its Child wilt greet
A coming as humble as mine?
For sake of the Faith that holdeth the pen, 
For the glory of God and the true peace of men
In the letters of every line
Wilt welcome the message I bring with me?
And say to me: "I have a place for thee?
Tell me your story, sing me your song,
Come as a friend comes looked-for long,— 
Out of the din of the world's rude throng,
Where the True is shy — and the False is strong —
Enter and speak to my very heart
And talk to my mind in the tones of truth
Not in the artful accents of art
But frank with the freshness of gladsome youth."
Wilt welcome me thus as a welcome guest?
Thanks ! STYLUS will come again to you,
To bring to you thoughts if not the Best,
Still something Beautiful, Good, and True.
